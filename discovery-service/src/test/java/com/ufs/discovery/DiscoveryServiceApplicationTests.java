/**
 * Integration test class for the Discovery Service Application.
 * 
 * This test class validates that the Spring Boot application context for the Discovery Service
 * can be loaded successfully, serving as a fundamental smoke test to ensure the service starts
 * without configuration errors. The Discovery Service is a critical infrastructure component
 * in the Unified Financial Services Platform's microservices architecture, providing service
 * registry capabilities using Netflix Eureka.
 * 
 * The test verifies that:
 * - All Spring Boot auto-configuration is properly applied
 * - Eureka Server configuration is correctly loaded
 * - Application context beans are properly initialized
 * - No configuration conflicts exist that would prevent startup
 * 
 * This integration test is essential for validating the Discovery Service's ability to:
 * - Act as a central service registry for microservices
 * - Support service discovery and health monitoring
 * - Enable client-side load balancing through service location
 * - Maintain high availability for the distributed system
 * 
 * Testing Strategy:
 * This test follows the "smoke test" pattern, focusing on application context loading
 * rather than detailed functional testing. It ensures that the foundational infrastructure
 * is properly configured before more complex integration tests are executed.
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * The test validates that the application can start within acceptable timeframes,
 * which is crucial for supporting the platform's 99.99% uptime requirements and
 * sub-second response time expectations for service registry operations.
 * 
 * Security Validation:
 * While this test doesn't explicitly test security features, it ensures that
 * security-related auto-configuration (OAuth2 integration, SSL configuration)
 * doesn't prevent the application from starting successfully.

     * Integration test method that verifies the Spring application context loads successfully.
     * 
     * This test serves as a fundamental smoke test for the Discovery Service application,
     * ensuring that all configuration is correct and the service can start without errors.
     * The test validates that the Spring Boot application context is properly initialized
     * with all necessary components for the Eureka-based service discovery functionality.
     * 
     * Test Execution Flow:
     * 1. The Spring Test framework initializes the ApplicationContext using @SpringBootTest
     * 2. All Spring Boot auto-configuration is applied, including Eureka Server setup
     * 3. The ApplicationContext is autowired into the test instance
     * 4. The assertion verifies that the context is not null, confirming successful initialization
     * 
     * What This Test Validates:
     * - Spring Boot application can start successfully
     * - Eureka Server auto-configuration is properly applied
     * - All required beans are created and initialized
     * - No configuration conflicts or missing dependencies exist
     * - Embedded web server configuration is correct
     * - Application properties are properly loaded and applied
     * 
     * Why This Test Is Critical:
     * The Discovery Service is a foundational component in the microservices architecture.
     * If this service fails to start, the entire distributed system cannot function properly
     * as other services depend on it for service registration and discovery capabilities.
     * 
     * This test ensures that:
     * - The service registry can accept registrations from other microservices
     * - Service discovery queries can be processed
     * - Health monitoring and automatic deregistration can function
     * - The Eureka dashboard is accessible for operational monitoring
     * 
     * Integration with Platform Requirements:
     * This test supports the platform's requirements for:
     * - 99.99% uptime by ensuring reliable service startup
     * - Sub-second response times by validating efficient initialization
     * - Microservices architecture by confirming service discovery availability
     * - Horizontal scalability by ensuring consistent startup behavior
     * 
     * Failure Scenarios:
     * If this test fails, it typically indicates:
     * - Missing or incorrect configuration properties
     * - Dependency version conflicts
     * - Port binding issues
     * - Classpath or resource loading problems
     * - Auto-configuration conflicts
     * 
     * The test failure would prevent deployment to higher environments,
     * ensuring that only properly configured services reach production.
     * 
     * @throws AssertionError if the application context is null, indicating
     *                       that the Spring Boot application failed to start
     *                       or the context could not be properly initialized
