/**
 * Discovery Service Application for the Unified Financial Services Platform
 * 
 * This application serves as the central service registry for the microservices architecture,
 * providing service discovery capabilities using Netflix Eureka. It enables microservices
 * to register themselves and discover other services dynamically, supporting the platform's
 * distributed architecture requirements.
 * 
 * The Discovery Service is a critical infrastructure component that:
 * - Maintains a registry of all available microservices
 * - Provides health monitoring and automatic service deregistration
 * - Enables client-side load balancing through service location
 * - Supports horizontal scaling of the microservices ecosystem
 * - Integrates with Spring Cloud for configuration and circuit breaker patterns
 * 
 * This service operates as part of the broader financial services platform that includes:
 * - Customer onboarding and KYC/AML services
 * - Real-time transaction processing
 * - AI-powered risk assessment and fraud detection
 * - Regulatory compliance automation
 * - Blockchain-based settlement processing
 * 
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - 99.99% uptime to ensure service discovery availability
 * - Sub-second response times for service registry queries
 * - Support for 1000+ registered service instances
 * - Automatic failover and cluster replication capabilities
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Integration with OAuth2 authentication framework
 * - Service registration validation and authorization
 * - Encrypted communication between services and registry
 * - Audit logging for service registration and discovery events

     * Main entry point for the Discovery Service Application.

     * This method bootstraps the Spring Boot application and initializes the Eureka server
     * that will act as the service registry for the microservices ecosystem. The application
     * will start an embedded web server (default: Tomcat) and begin accepting service
     * registrations from other microservices in the platform.
     * 
     * The SpringApplication.run method performs the following key operations:
     * 1. Creates and configures the Spring application context
     * 2. Initializes the Eureka server with default or configured settings
     * 3. Starts the embedded web server on the configured port (default: 8761)
     * 4. Begins accepting service registration requests from client applications
     * 5. Enables the Eureka dashboard for monitoring registered services
     * 
     * Environment Configuration:
     * The application supports configuration through:
     * - application.yml/application.properties files
     * - Environment variables for containerized deployments
     * - Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management
     * - Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets for cloud-native deployments
     * 
     * High Availability Setup:
     * In production environments, multiple instances of this Discovery Service
     * should be deployed across different availability zones with peer-to-peer
     * replication enabled to ensure service registry availability.
     * 
     * Monitoring and Observability:
     * The application integrates with:
     * - Micrometer for metrics collection and export to Prometheus
     * - Spring Boot Actuator for health checks and application insights
     * - Distributed tracing through Spring Cloud Sleuth integration
     * - Centralized logging for audit and operational monitoring
     * 
     * @param args Command line arguments passed to the application.
     *             Common arguments include:
     *             --server.port=8761 (override default Eureka server port)
     *             --spring.profiles.active=production (activate production profile)
     *             --eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false (standalone mode)
     *             --eureka.client.fetch-registry=false (standalone mode)
     * 
     * @throws Exception if the application fails to start due to configuration issues,
     *                   port binding conflicts, or other startup problems
