 * - Implements sub-second response times for customer profile queries
 * - Provides type-safe query methods with proper error handling
 * 
 * Performance Optimization:
 * - Indexed customer ID queries for O(log n) lookup performance
 * - Paginated result sets for large-scale analytics operations
 * - Optimized aggregation pipelines for complex financial calculations
 * - Connection pooling support for high-concurrency scenarios
 * - Query result caching compatibility for frequently accessed profiles
 * 
 * Security and Compliance Considerations:
 * - All queries maintain data isolation by customer boundaries

 * 
 * Usage Examples:
 * <pre>
 * // Basic customer profile retrieval
 * Optional&lt;WellnessProfile&gt; profile = repository.findByCustomerId("CUST-12345");
 * 
 * // Wellness score range analysis
 * List&lt;WellnessProfile&gt; lowScoreProfiles = repository.findByWellnessScoreLessThan(50.0);
 * 
 * // Recent profile updates for sync processing
 * List&lt;WellnessProfile&gt; recentUpdates = repository.findByLastUpdatedAfter(yesterday);
 * </pre>

     * 
     * This method provides the primary access pattern for customer-specific wellness
     * profile retrieval, supporting personalized financial guidance and dashboard
     * functionality. The customer ID is indexed for O(log n) performance.
     * 
     * Business Use Cases:
     * - Customer dashboard wellness score display
     * - Personalized recommendation engine input
     * - Financial advisor customer profile access
     * - Mobile application wellness profile sync
     * - Customer service representative profile lookup
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Sub-second response time for 99% of requests
     * - Leverages unique index on customer_id field
     * - Optimized for high-frequency customer access patterns
     * - Connection pool friendly for concurrent access
     * 
     * Security Considerations:
     * - Customer ID should be validated before query execution
     * - Results contain sensitive financial information requiring encryption
     * - Audit logging recommended for compliance requirements
     * - Rate limiting may be applied for API endpoint usage
