     * Main application entry point for the Financial Wellness Service.
     * 
     * This method bootstraps and launches the Spring Boot application,
     * initializing all necessary components for the financial wellness
     * microservice including:
     * 
     * - Application context and dependency injection container
     * - Web server (embedded Tomcat) for REST API endpoints
     * - Database connections for PostgreSQL and MongoDB
     * - Service discovery client registration
     * - Security configuration and authentication mechanisms
     * - Actuator endpoints for health monitoring and metrics
     * - Integration with external financial APIs and services
     * 
     * The service operates as part of a microservices architecture,
     * communicating with other platform components through:
     * - RESTful APIs for synchronous communication
     * - Event-driven messaging (Kafka) for asynchronous operations
     * - Service mesh (Istio) for traffic management and security
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Optimized for high-throughput financial data processing
     * - Implements connection pooling for database efficiency
     * - Utilizes caching strategies for frequently accessed data
     * - Supports graceful shutdown and zero-downtime deployments
     * 
     * Monitoring and Observability:
     * - Micrometer metrics integration for application monitoring
     * - Distributed tracing with Jaeger for request flow visibility
     * - Structured logging for comprehensive audit trails
     * - Health checks and readiness probes for Kubernetes deployment
     * 
     * @param args Command-line arguments passed to the application.
     *             Supports standard Spring Boot configuration parameters:
     *             - --server.port: Override default server port
     *             - --spring.profiles.active: Specify active configuration profiles
     *             - --spring.config.location: Custom configuration file locations
     *             - --logging.level.*: Runtime logging level adjustments
     *             
     *             Example usage:
     *             java -jar financial-wellness-service.jar --server.port=8080 --spring.profiles.active=production
     * 
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if invalid configuration parameters are provided
     * @throws RuntimeException if critical application components fail to initialize
