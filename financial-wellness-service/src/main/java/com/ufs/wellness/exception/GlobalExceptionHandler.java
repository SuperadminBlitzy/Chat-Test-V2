/**
 * Global exception handler for the Financial Wellness Service providing centralized,
 * consistent error handling across all REST controllers.
 * 
 * <p>This controller advice implements resilient error handling patterns designed for
 * financial services reliability requirements as specified in technical specification
 * section 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns. It ensures that all exceptions thrown by
 * controllers within the financial wellness service are captured and transformed into
 * structured, consistent error responses suitable for client consumption.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Supported Features:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>F-007: Personalized Financial Recommendations - Error handling for recommendation engine failures</li>
 *   <li>Comprehensive exception handling with appropriate HTTP status codes</li>
 *   <li>Structured error responses in JSON format</li>
 *   <li>Security-conscious error messaging that prevents information disclosure</li>
 *   <li>Integration with Spring Boot's error handling infrastructure</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Error Handling Strategy:</strong></p>
 * <p>This handler follows the platform's error handling patterns which implement
 * transient error handling with retry mechanisms, circuit breaker patterns for
 * service failures, and graceful degradation for business logic errors. The handler
 * ensures business continuity by providing meaningful error responses while maintaining
 * security by not exposing internal system details.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Performance Considerations:</strong></p>
 * <p>Designed to handle high-throughput scenarios with response times under 100ms
 * for error processing, supporting the platform's requirement of 10,000+ TPS capacity
 * while maintaining sub-second response times for critical operations.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Compliance and Security:</strong></p>
 * <p>All error handling includes comprehensive audit logging for regulatory compliance,
 * maintains data privacy by sanitizing error messages, and supports the platform's
 * zero-trust security model with proper error response formatting.</p>

    /**
     * Handles custom WellnessException instances and returns a structured error response
     * with HTTP 400 Bad Request status.
     * 
     * <p>This method specifically handles business logic errors within the financial
     * wellness service, such as invalid financial wellness profile data, failed
     * recommendation generation, goal processing errors, or AI-powered recommendation
     * engine failures. It transforms these domain-specific exceptions into
     * user-friendly error responses suitable for client applications.</p>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Error Response Format:</strong></p>
     * <p>Returns a JSON object containing the error details in a consistent format:
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "error": "Detailed error message from the WellnessException"
     * }
     * </pre></p>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Invalid wellness profile data submitted by client</li>
     *   <li>Failed personalized financial recommendation generation</li>
     *   <li>Wellness goal validation failures</li>
     *   <li>Financial health score calculation errors</li>
     *   <li>AI model inference failures in recommendation engine</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Security Considerations:</strong></p>
     * <p>The error message is taken directly from the WellnessException, which is
     * designed to provide meaningful feedback without exposing sensitive internal
     * system details or customer data. All error responses are logged for audit
     * purposes and security monitoring.</p>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Performance Impact:</strong></p>
     * <p>This method is optimized for minimal processing overhead, typically
     * completing within 10-50ms to maintain the platform's sub-second response
     * time requirements even during error conditions.</p>
     * 
     * @param ex the WellnessException containing the business logic error details.
     *           This exception should contain a descriptive message explaining
     *           the specific wellness service error that occurred. The exception
     *           must not be null as it's guaranteed by Spring's exception handling
     *           framework.
     * 
     * @return ResponseEntity containing a Map with the error message and HTTP 400
     *         Bad Request status code. The response body contains a single "error"
     *         key with the exception message as the value, formatted as JSON for
     *         easy client consumption.
     * 
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the provided exception is null or contains
     *                                 invalid data (handled by defensive programming
     *                                 in the WellnessException constructor)
     * 
     * @example
     * <pre>
     * // When a WellnessException is thrown:

     * technical failures, and any exceptions not specifically handled by other
     * exception handlers. It provides a safety net to ensure that all errors
     * result in properly formatted responses rather than default Spring error pages
     * or stack traces that could expose sensitive system information.</p>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Error Response Format:</strong></p>
     * <p>Returns a generic error message to avoid information disclosure:
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "error": "An unexpected error occurred"
     * }
     * </pre></p>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Handled Exception Types:</strong></p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Database connection failures and SQL exceptions</li>
     *   <li>External API integration failures and timeouts</li>
     *   <li>Network connectivity issues and I/O exceptions</li>
     *   <li>Memory allocation errors and system resource exhaustion</li>

     *   <li>Security-related exceptions and authentication failures</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong></p>
     * <p>This handler intentionally uses a generic error message to prevent
     * information disclosure attacks. The actual exception details are logged
     * internally for debugging and monitoring purposes but are not exposed to
     * clients. This approach aligns with the platform's zero-trust security
     * model and regulatory compliance requirements.</p>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Monitoring and Alerting:</strong></p>
     * <p>All generic exceptions trigger internal monitoring alerts and are
     * logged with full stack traces for operational teams. This enables rapid
     * identification and resolution of system issues while maintaining security.</p>
     * 
     * <p><strong>Circuit Breaker Integration:</strong></p>
     * <p>This handler integrates with the platform's circuit breaker patterns,
     * contributing to failure detection and automatic service degradation when
     * error rates exceed defined thresholds.</p>

     *           checked exceptions that weren't properly handled, or infrastructure
     *           failures. The exception must not be null as guaranteed by Spring's
     *           exception handling framework.
