     *                   in the system. The customer ID should follow the platform's standard 
     *                   identifier format and be properly authenticated and authorized for 
     *                   recommendation access. Format validation includes length constraints,

     *         profile, goals, and risk tolerance. The returned list is ordered by recommendation 
     *         priority (CRITICAL first, INFORMATIONAL last) and includes detailed guidance 
     *         for implementation. An empty list is returned if the customer has no applicable 
     *         recommendations or if the customer's profile lacks sufficient data for analysis. 
     *         The list is never null, ensuring consistent API behavior for client applications.
     *

     *         failure to assist with client-side debugging and error resolution.
     * 
     * @throws CustomerNotFoundException if the specified customerId does not exist in the 
     *         system or if the customer record is in an inactive state that prevents 
     *         recommendation generation. This exception provides clear guidance on customer 
     *         status verification and resolution steps.
     * 
     * @throws InsufficientDataException if the customer's profile lacks sufficient financial 
     *         data to generate meaningful recommendations. This exception indicates specific 
     *         data requirements that must be fulfilled before recommendations can be generated, 
     *         guiding the data collection process.
     * 
     * @throws RecommendationServiceException if the recommendation generation process encounters 
     *         system-level errors, including AI model failures, data integration issues, or 
     *         external service dependencies. This exception wraps underlying technical errors 
     *         while providing user-friendly error messages and suggested remediation steps.
     * 
     * @throws SecurityException if the requesting context lacks proper authorization to access 
     *         the customer's financial data or generate recommendations. This exception enforces 
     *         the platform's role-based access control and data privacy requirements.
