     * Default constructor for the Financial Wellness Service Application Tests.
     * 
     * This constructor is automatically invoked by the JUnit 5 test framework
     * during test class instantiation. The constructor initializes the test
     * environment for comprehensive integration testing of the Financial
     * Wellness Service application.
     * 
     * Constructor Responsibilities:
     * - Prepares the test execution environment
     * - Initializes any required test fixtures (handled by Spring Boot Test)
     * - Sets up the testing context for Spring Boot application testing
     * 
     * Spring Boot Test Framework Integration:
     * The @SpringBootTest annotation on the class ensures that:
     * - Full application context is loaded during test execution
     * - All Spring Boot auto-configuration is applied
     * - Application properties are loaded from test resources
     * - Test-specific configuration profiles can be activated
     * - Mock and test beans can be registered as needed
     * 
     * Test Environment Characteristics:
     * - Uses Spring Boot's embedded server for testing (if web layer is included)
     * - Provides access to all application beans and components
     * - Supports dependency injection within test methods
     * - Enables testing of actual application behavior vs. unit testing
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * - Integration tests are slower than unit tests due to full context loading
     * - Context caching is employed to optimize repeated test execution
     * - Test slicing can be used for focused testing of specific layers
     * 
     * Testing Best Practices Applied:
     * - Follows Spring Boot testing conventions
     * - Supports both integration and end-to-end testing scenarios
     * - Enables testing of actual bean wiring and configuration
     * - Provides foundation for testing complex microservice interactions
