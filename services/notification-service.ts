/**
 * Notification Service Module for Unified Financial Services Platform
 * 
 * This service module handles all API interactions with the backend notification service,
 * providing comprehensive notification management capabilities for the financial services
 * platform. It supports real-time transaction monitoring alerts, customer dashboard
 * notifications, and event processing workflow notifications as outlined in the
 * technical requirements.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Fetches user-specific notifications with proper authentication
 * - Marks individual notifications as read with optimistic updates
 * - Bulk marks all notifications as read for improved user experience
 * - Type-safe API interactions using TypeScript interfaces
 * - Enterprise-grade error handling and logging
 * - Supports F-008: Real-time Transaction Monitoring notification display
 * - Enables F-013: Customer Dashboard notification integration
 * - Processes notifications from Event Processing Flow as per F-4.1.2
 * 
 * Architecture Alignment:
 * - Implements client-side notification service layer for frontend components
 * - Integrates with backend notification microservice via centralized API client
 * - Supports real-time notification updates and user preference management
 * - Provides consistent error handling and user feedback mechanisms
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - All API calls are automatically authenticated via JWT tokens
 * - User identity is inferred from authentication context
 * - Notification access is scoped to authenticated user only
 * - Follows RBAC principles for notification access control

/**
 * Notification Service Singleton Object
 * 
 * This object serves as the primary interface for all notification-related
 * operations in the frontend application. It provides a clean, organized
 * API surface that abstracts the complexity of backend API interactions
 * while maintaining type safety and consistent error handling.
 * 
 * The service object is designed as a singleton to ensure consistent
 * state management and to provide a centralized point for notification
 * operations across the entire application. It supports dependency
 * injection patterns and can be easily mocked for testing purposes.
 * 
 * Architecture Benefits:
 * - Centralized notification logic for maintainability
 * - Consistent API interface across all frontend components
 * - Type-safe operations with comprehensive TypeScript support
 * - Enterprise-grade error handling and logging
 * - Easy testing and mocking capabilities
 * - Clear separation of concerns between UI and API logic
 * 
 * Usage Examples:
 * ```typescript
 * // Import the service in React components
 * import { notificationService } from '../services/notification-service';
 * 
 * // Use in component lifecycle or event handlers
 * const handleLoadNotifications = async () => {
 *   try {
 *     const notifications = await notificationService.getUserNotifications();
 *     setNotifications(notifications);
 *   } catch (error) {
 *     setError('Failed to load notifications');
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * // Mark individual notification as read
 * const handleNotificationClick = async (notificationId: string) => {
 *   try {
 *     await notificationService.markNotificationAsRead(notificationId);
 *     // Update local state or refresh data
 *   } catch (error) {
 *     console.error('Failed to mark notification as read');
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * // Bulk mark all as read
 * const handleMarkAllRead = async () => {
 *   try {
 *     await notificationService.markAllNotificationsAsRead();
 *     // Update UI to show all notifications as read
 *   } catch (error) {
 *     console.error('Failed to mark all notifications as read');
