/**
 * Data Transfer Object (DTO) for sending regulatory report data in API responses.
 * 
 * This class encapsulates the data related to a compliance report that is sent to the client
 * as part of the F-003: Regulatory Compliance Automation feature. It supports the functional
 * requirement F-003-RQ-003 for generating and monitoring compliance reports with continuous
 * assessments and compliance status monitoring across operational units.
 * 
 * The regulatory compliance system maintains a 24-hour update cycle with 99.9% accuracy
 * in change detection and requires complete audit trails for all compliance activities.
 * This DTO serves as the standardized response format for all regulatory reporting endpoints.
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - Designed to support high-throughput operations with sub-second response times
 * - Optimized for JSON serialization/deserialization in REST API responses
 * - Minimal memory footprint for efficient processing of large report datasets
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Contains sensitive regulatory information requiring proper access controls
 * - Should be transmitted over encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS)
 * - Audit logging should capture all access to report data
 * 
 * Compliance Considerations:
 * - Supports SOC2, PCI DSS, GDPR compliance requirements
 * - Maintains data integrity for regulatory audit trails
 * - Enables real-time compliance monitoring and reporting
