/**
 * Spring Data JPA Repository for AmlCheck Entity Operations
 * 
 * This repository interface provides comprehensive database access functionality for 
 * Anti-Money Laundering (AML) check records as part of the F-003 Regulatory Compliance 
 * Automation and F-004 Digital Customer Onboarding functional requirements.
 * 
 * The repository supports the platform's compliance automation capabilities by enabling
 * efficient querying, filtering, and management of AML screening results across multiple
 * regulatory frameworks including:
 * 
 * - Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance monitoring
 * - FinCEN Customer Due Diligence (CDD) requirements
 * - OFAC Sanctions Programs screening
 * - EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives compliance
 * - FATF Recommendations implementation
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Standard CRUD operations through JpaRepository inheritance
 * - Custom query methods for compliance-specific business logic
 * - Risk-based filtering for automated decision workflows
 * - Audit trail support for regulatory examination requirements
 * - High-performance queries optimized for compliance reporting
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Supports high-volume screening operations (10,000+ TPS capacity)
 * - Optimized for real-time compliance monitoring requirements
 * - Indexed queries for fast watchlist matching and risk assessment
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - All queries maintain data integrity and confidentiality standards
 * - Results filtered based on user access control permissions
 * - Audit logging enabled for all repository operations
