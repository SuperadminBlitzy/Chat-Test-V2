/**
 * Spring Data JPA Repository Interface for ComplianceReport Entity Management
 * 
 * This repository interface provides comprehensive data access capabilities for managing
 * ComplianceReport entities within the Unified Financial Services Platform. It serves as
 * the primary data access layer for the F-003: Regulatory Compliance Automation feature,
 * supporting both standard CRUD operations and specialized compliance reporting queries.
 * 
 * Functional Requirements Addressed:
 * 
 * F-003-RQ-003: Compliance Reporting
 * This repository enables continuous assessments and compliance status monitoring across
 * operational units by providing efficient data access methods for retrieving compliance
 * reports based on status, generation dates, and other criteria essential for regulatory
 * reporting workflows and executive dashboards.
 * 
 * F-003-RQ-004: Audit Trail Management  
 * The repository supports complete audit trails for all compliance activities by providing
 * query methods that enable chronological retrieval of compliance reports, status tracking,
 * and comprehensive audit trail reconstruction for regulatory examination and internal
 * compliance oversight requirements.
 * 
 * Repository Architecture and Design Principles:
 * 
 * Spring Data JPA Integration:
 * - Extends JpaRepository<ComplianceReport, Long> for automatic CRUD operations
 * - Leverages Spring Data JPA query derivation for type-safe, automatic query generation
 * - Supports transaction management and connection pooling through Spring's infrastructure
 * - Integrates with Spring Boot's auto-configuration for seamless database connectivity
 * 
 * Database Performance Optimization:
 * - Designed for PostgreSQL 16+ with optimized query patterns for compliance operations
 * - Custom query methods use database indexes on status and generation_date columns
 * - Supports high-frequency compliance reporting operations (10,000+ TPS capability)
 * - Connection pooling configured for enterprise-scale compliance processing
 * 
 * Enterprise Security Considerations:
 * - Repository operations inherit Spring Security context for role-based access control
 * - All data access operations support audit logging through Spring Data JPA auditing
 * - Sensitive compliance data access is governed by institutional access policies
 * - Supports encrypted database connections and field-level encryption for compliance data
 * 
 * Regulatory Compliance Context:
 * 
 * The compliance reporting landscape in 2025 continues to evolve with heightened supervisory
 * intensity across financial and operational resilience, consumer protection, ESG, and digital
 * finance. This repository supports automated reporting across multiple regulatory frameworks
 * including Basel III/IV, PSD3, MiFID II/III, AML/KYC regulations, GDPR, and other evolving
 * regulatory requirements.
 * 
 * Query Method Design Philosophy:
 * - Method names follow Spring Data JPA conventions for automatic query derivation
 * - Return types use List<ComplianceReport> for efficient collection handling
 * - Parameter types align with entity field types for type safety and performance
 * - Methods are designed to support both operational queries and regulatory reporting needs
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - F-001: Unified Data Integration Platform - Sources compliance data from integrated systems
 * - F-002: AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine - Stores risk assessment results and compliance scores
 * - F-015: Compliance Control Center - Provides data for real-time compliance dashboards
 * - External regulatory APIs - Supports compliance report submission and tracking workflows
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Sub-second response times for compliance report queries supporting real-time dashboards
 * - Optimized for regulatory reporting cycles with 24-hour update requirements
 * - Scalable design supporting horizontal partitioning for compliance data archival
 * - Connection pooling and query optimization for enterprise-scale compliance operations
 * 
 * Data Consistency and Integrity:
 * - ACID transaction support for compliance data consistency across related entities
 * - Referential integrity maintained through JPA relationships with ComplianceCheck entities
 * - Optimistic locking support for concurrent compliance report updates
 * - Audit trail preservation through entity versioning and temporal data management

    /**
     * Finds all compliance reports matching the specified status.
     * 
     * This query method supports compliance monitoring workflows by enabling retrieval
     * of reports based on their processing status. The method is essential for:
     * - Real-time compliance dashboard operations showing reports by status
     * - Workflow management for reports requiring specific processing actions
     * - Regulatory submission queue management and status tracking
     * - Exception handling for failed or pending compliance reports
     * - Performance monitoring and SLA compliance measurement
     * 
     * Query Derivation Strategy:
     * Spring Data JPA automatically generates the following optimized SQL query:
     * SELECT * FROM compliance_report WHERE status = ?1 ORDER BY generation_date DESC
     * 
     * The query leverages the database index on the 'status' column for optimal performance
     * and includes automatic ordering by generation date for chronological report review.
     * 
     * Business Use Cases:
     * - Compliance Control Center dashboard filtering reports by status
     * - Automated workflow processing for reports in specific states
     * - Regulatory examination preparation requiring reports in submitted status
     * - Exception reporting and remediation workflows for failed compliance reports
     * - Performance dashboards showing compliance processing efficiency metrics
     * 
     * Status Values and Operational Significance:
     * - "DRAFT": Reports being prepared, requiring completion before regulatory submission
     * - "UNDER_REVIEW": Reports awaiting manual review, approval, or additional analysis
     * - "APPROVED": Reports validated and approved for regulatory submission
     * - "SUBMITTED": Reports successfully submitted to appropriate regulatory authorities
     * - "ACKNOWLEDGED": Reports confirmed received and accepted by regulatory authorities
     * - "REJECTED": Reports rejected requiring remediation before resubmission
     * - "ARCHIVED": Reports completed regulatory lifecycle and archived for retention
     * - "ERROR": Reports with technical or processing errors requiring investigation
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Sub-second response time for status-based queries supporting real-time dashboards
     * - Optimized database index usage for efficient retrieval from large compliance datasets
     * - Results automatically ordered by generation date for chronological compliance review
     * - Supports pagination through inherited PagingAndSortingRepository methods when needed
     * 
     * Integration with Compliance Workflows:
     * - F-003-RQ-001: Regulatory change monitoring - Status-based report filtering for impact analysis
     * - F-003-RQ-003: Compliance reporting - Status-driven automated submission workflows
     * - F-015: Compliance Control Center - Real-time status-based dashboard population
     * - External regulatory systems - Status validation before submission attempts
     * 
     * @param status String - The compliance report status to filter by, must not be null
     *               Valid status values include: DRAFT, UNDER_REVIEW, APPROVED, SUBMITTED,

    /**
     * Finds all compliance reports generated within the specified date range (inclusive).
     * 
     * This query method supports regulatory reporting requirements by enabling retrieval
