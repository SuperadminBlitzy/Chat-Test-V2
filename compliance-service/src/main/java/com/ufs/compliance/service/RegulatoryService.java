    /**
     * Removes a regulatory rule from the system's regulatory rules repository. This method
     * supports regulatory rule lifecycle management, including the retirement of obsolete
     * regulations and the removal of superseded regulatory requirements.
     * 
     * <h3>Deletion Process and Safeguards</h3>
     * The method implements comprehensive safeguards for regulatory rule deletion:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>Validates that the specified rule ID exists in the system</li>
     *   <li>Performs dependency analysis to identify references to the rule</li>
     *   <li>Checks for active compliance assessments using the rule</li>
     *   <li>Verifies regulatory authority approval for rule retirement</li>
     *   <li>Executes soft deletion (marking as inactive) rather than hard deletion</li>
     *   <li>Triggers regulatory change events for dependent systems</li>
     *   <li>Updates compliance monitoring to exclude the deleted rule</li>
     *   <li>Generates comprehensive audit log entries</li>
     * </ol>
     * 
     * <h3>Dependency Analysis and Impact Assessment</h3>
     * Before deletion, the system performs thorough dependency analysis:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Identifies compliance reports that reference the rule</li>
     *   <li>Locates business processes that depend on the rule</li>
     *   <li>Finds related regulatory rules that may be affected</li>
     *   <li>Determines risk assessment models using the rule</li>
     *   <li>Checks for historical compliance data dependent on the rule</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Soft Deletion Strategy</h3>
     * For regulatory compliance and audit requirements, the system implements soft deletion:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Rule is marked as inactive (isActive = false) rather than physically removed</li>
     *   <li>Deletion timestamp is recorded for audit trail purposes</li>
     *   <li>Rule remains accessible for historical reporting and compliance reviews</li>
     *   <li>Logical deletion preserves referential integrity with dependent data</li>
     *   <li>Physical deletion may be performed after regulatory retention periods expire</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Regulatory Authority Compliance</h3>
     * Rule deletion must comply with regulatory authority requirements:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Verification that the rule has been officially superseded or retired</li>
     *   <li>Confirmation that no active regulatory obligations remain</li>
     *   <li>Documentation of regulatory authority approval for rule retirement</li>
     *   <li>Compliance with data retention requirements for audit purposes</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Event-Driven System Integration</h3>
     * Rule deletion triggers comprehensive system events:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>RegulatoryRuleDeleted event published to 'regulatory-events' Kafka topic</li>
     *   <li>Compliance system refresh events to update rule coverage</li>
     *   <li>Risk assessment model updates to remove rule dependencies</li>
     *   <li>Dashboard and reporting system updates</li>
     *   <li>Notification events for affected stakeholders</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Compliance System Updates</h3>
     * Deletion automatically triggers updates across compliance systems:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Compliance checking algorithms updated to exclude deleted rule</li>
     *   <li>Risk scoring models recalculated without the rule</li>
     *   <li>Regulatory reporting templates updated</li>
     *   <li>Monitoring dashboards refreshed to reflect rule removal</li>
     *   <li>Policy enforcement systems updated</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Historical Data Preservation</h3>
     * Despite deletion, historical compliance data is preserved:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Past compliance assessments referencing the rule remain intact</li>
     *   <li>Historical reports maintain their original rule references</li>
     *   <li>Audit trails preserve the complete rule lifecycle</li>
     *   <li>Regulatory examination support maintains data accessibility</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Multi-Jurisdictional Considerations</h3>
     * For rules affecting multiple jurisdictions:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Verification that rule retirement applies to all relevant jurisdictions</li>
     *   <li>Regional regulatory authority notification</li>
     *   <li>Cross-border compliance impact assessment</li>
     *   <li>Jurisdiction-specific retention requirement compliance</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Rollback and Recovery</h3>
     * The deletion process supports rollback scenarios:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Soft deletion allows for rule reactivation if required</li>
     *   <li>Version control enables restoration to previous states</li>
     *   <li>Audit trail provides complete change history</li>
     *   <li>Backup and recovery procedures protect against data loss</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Security and Authorization</h3>
     * Rule deletion requires elevated permissions:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Caller must have REGULATORY_RULE_DELETE permission</li>
     *   <li>Additional approvals may be required for critical rules</li>
     *   <li>Multi-person authorization for sensitive regulatory rules</li>
     *   <li>Complete audit logging of all deletion activities</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <h3>Performance and System Impact</h3>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Asynchronous processing for complex dependency updates</li>
     *   <li>Minimized system impact through efficient deletion strategies</li>
     *   <li>Cache invalidation for maintaining system performance</li>
     *   <li>Gradual propagation of deletion effects across distributed systems</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @param id The unique database identifier of the regulatory rule to delete.
     *           Must be a non-null Long value representing an existing rule.
     * 
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the provided ID is null or invalid
     * @throws RegulatoryRuleNotFoundException if no rule exists with the specified ID
     * @throws RegulatoryRuleDeletionException if the rule cannot be deleted due to dependencies
     * @throws RegulatoryAuthorityException if regulatory authority approval is required
     * @throws DataAccessException if database operations fail
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller lacks required permissions
     * @throws SystemException if unexpected system errors occur during deletion
     * 
     * @implNote Implementations should prioritize data integrity and regulatory compliance
     *           over performance. The method should handle dependencies gracefully and
     *           provide clear error messages for failed deletion attempts.
