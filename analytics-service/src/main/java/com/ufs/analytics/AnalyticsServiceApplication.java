/**
 * Main application class for the Analytics Service within the Unified Financial Services Platform.
 * 
 * This class serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application, responsible for bootstrapping
 * and running the Analytics Service microservice. The Analytics Service is a critical component
 * of the platform's AI and Analytics Features, providing predictive analytics dashboards and 
 * real-time transaction monitoring capabilities as specified in requirements F-005 and F-008.
 * 
 * The service addresses key business requirements including:
 * - AI-powered risk assessment and fraud detection
 * - Real-time transaction monitoring and analysis
 * - Predictive analytics for customer behavior and market trends
 * - Financial data processing and insights generation
 * 
 * Architecture Context:
 * This microservice is part of a larger microservices architecture designed to address the critical
 * fragmentation challenges facing Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) institutions.
 * The platform integrates AI-powered risk assessment, regulatory compliance automation, digital
 * onboarding, personalized financial wellness tools, blockchain-based settlements, and predictive
 * analytics into a single, unified ecosystem.
 * 
 * Technical Implementation:
 * - Built using Spring Boot 3.2+ framework with Java 21 LTS
 * - Follows microservices architecture patterns with event-driven communication
 * - Designed for horizontal scalability and high-performance requirements
 * - Supports sub-second response times and 10,000+ TPS capacity
 * - Implements comprehensive security measures including end-to-end encryption
 * 
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - Response Time: <1 second for 99% of requests
 * - Throughput: 10,000+ transactions per second
 * - Availability: 99.99% uptime
 * - Scalability: Horizontal scaling for 10x growth without architectural changes
 * 
 * Security and Compliance:
 * - SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR compliance
 * - End-to-end encryption for all data flows
 * - Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
 * - Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Unified Data Integration Platform (F-001) for real-time data synchronization
 * - AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine (F-002) for risk scoring and fraud detection
 * - Regulatory Compliance Automation (F-003) for compliance monitoring
 * - External financial APIs including Stripe, Plaid, Experian, Bloomberg
 * - Message broker integration via Apache Kafka for event streaming
 * 
 * Monitoring and Observability:
 * - Application metrics collection via Micrometer
 * - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
 * - Centralized logging with ELK Stack
 * - Performance monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

     * Default constructor for the AnalyticsServiceApplication class.
     * 
     * This constructor is implicitly called during application startup and follows
     * Spring Boot's standard initialization patterns. The @SpringBootApplication
     * annotation on the class enables:
     * 
     * 1. @EnableAutoConfiguration: Automatically configures Spring based on classpath dependencies
     * 2. @ComponentScan: Scans for Spring components in the current package and sub-packages
     * 3. @Configuration: Allows the class to be a source of bean definitions
     * 
     * The constructor doesn't require explicit implementation as Spring Boot handles
     * the application context initialization through its auto-configuration mechanisms.
     */
    public AnalyticsServiceApplication() {
        // Default constructor - Spring Boot handles initialization
        // Auto-configuration will set up:
        // - Database connections (PostgreSQL for transactional data, MongoDB for analytics)
        // - Redis for caching and session management
        // - Kafka for event streaming and real-time data processing
        // - Security configurations (OAuth2, JWT, RBAC)
        // - Monitoring and observability tools integration
        // - API gateway and service discovery registration
    }

    /**
     * The main method serves as the entry point for the Analytics Service Java application.
     * 
     * This method utilizes SpringApplication.run() to bootstrap the Spring application context,
     * which includes:
     * 
     * 1. Application Context Initialization:
     *    - Loads application configuration from application.yml/properties
     *    - Sets up database connections and connection pooling
     *    - Initializes caching mechanisms (Redis)
     *    - Configures message brokers (Kafka) for event streaming
     * 
     * 2. Microservice Registration:
     *    - Registers with service discovery (Spring Cloud)
     *    - Sets up health checks and monitoring endpoints
     *    - Configures circuit breakers for resilience
     * 
     * 3. Security Configuration:
     *    - Initializes OAuth2 and JWT authentication mechanisms
     *    - Sets up role-based access control (RBAC)
     *    - Configures encryption for data at rest and in transit
     * 
     * 4. Analytics Service Specific Setup:
     *    - Initializes AI/ML model serving infrastructure
     *    - Sets up real-time data processing pipelines
     *    - Configures predictive analytics engines
     *    - Establishes connections to external financial data providers
     * 
     * 5. Monitoring and Observability:
     *    - Starts metrics collection (Micrometer)
     *    - Initializes distributed tracing (Jaeger)
     *    - Sets up log aggregation and forwarding
     * 
     * Error Handling:
     * The application startup process includes comprehensive error handling to ensure
     * graceful failure and detailed logging for troubleshooting. Critical failures
     * during startup will prevent the service from starting and will be logged with
     * appropriate error details for operational teams.
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * The startup process is optimized for fast boot times while ensuring all critical
     * components are properly initialized. The application uses Spring Boot's lazy
     * initialization where appropriate to reduce startup time without compromising
     * functionality.
     * 
     * @param args Command-line arguments passed to the application.
     *             These can include:
     *             - --spring.profiles.active: Specify active Spring profiles (dev, staging, prod)
     *             - --server.port: Override default server port
     *             - --spring.config.location: Specify custom configuration file locations
     *             - Environment-specific overrides for database connections, API keys, etc.
     * 
     * @throws RuntimeException If critical application components fail to initialize
     *                         during startup, the application will fail fast with detailed
     *                         error information for troubleshooting.
