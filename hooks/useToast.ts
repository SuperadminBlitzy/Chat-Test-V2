/**
 * Custom React Hook: useToast
 * 
 * A custom React hook that provides a convenient and consistent method to display
 * toast notifications throughout the Unified Financial Services Platform. This hook
 * integrates seamlessly with the Redux store to manage notification state and supports
 * the User Interface and Experience Features requirements.
 * 
 * **Features Supported:**
 * - F-013: Customer Dashboard - Provides user feedback through toast notifications
 * - User Interface and Experience Features - Enhances user experience with consistent notifications
 * - Real-time Transaction Monitoring - Supports instant feedback for financial operations
 * - Compliance and Risk Management - Provides immediate alerts for critical system events
 * 
 * **Technical Architecture:**
 * - Integrates with Redux store for centralized notification state management
 * - Uses React's useCallback hook for performance optimization
 * - Generates unique notification identifiers for proper state management
 * - Supports automatic timestamp generation for chronological ordering
 * - Compatible with the microservices architecture and event-driven design
 * 
 * **Performance Optimizations:**
 * - Memoized toast function prevents unnecessary re-renders
 * - Minimal dependency array ensures optimal re-computation timing
 * - Efficient notification object creation with direct property assignment
 * - Optimized for high-frequency usage in real-time financial applications
 * 
 * **Usage Patterns:**
 * ```typescript
 * const { toast } = useToast();
 * 
 * // Success notification for completed transactions
 * toast('Transaction completed successfully', { type: 'success', duration: 5000 });
 * 
 * // Error notification for failed operations
 * toast('Failed to process payment', { type: 'error' });
 * 
 * // Info notification for system updates
 * toast('System maintenance scheduled', { type: 'info', duration: 10000 });
 * 
 * // Warning notification for security alerts
 * toast('Unusual activity detected', { type: 'warning' });
 * ```
 * 
 * **Integration Points:**
 * - Works with the notification-slice Redux store for state management
 * - Compatible with real-time WebSocket connections for instant notifications
 * - Supports the unified data integration platform for system-wide alerts
 * - Integrates with AI-powered risk assessment for automated notifications
 * 
 * @returns {UseToastReturn} Object containing the memoized toast function

  /**
   * Toast Function Implementation
   * 
   * Creates and dispatches a new toast notification to the Redux store.
   * This function handles the complete lifecycle of toast notification creation,
   * from generating unique identifiers to dispatching the notification action.
   * 
   * **Implementation Details:**
   * - Generates unique notification ID using timestamp and random number combination
   * - Creates notification object with all required properties
   * - Sets read status to false for new notifications
   * - Automatically assigns current timestamp for chronological ordering
   * - Dispatches addNotification action to update the Redux store
   * 
   * **Error Handling:**
   * - Gracefully handles all input parameters
   * - Ensures notification object integrity
   * - Maintains consistent behavior across all usage scenarios
   * 
   * **Performance Considerations:**
   * - Efficient ID generation algorithm
   * - Minimal object creation overhead
   * - Direct Redux dispatch without intermediate processing
   * - Optimized for high-frequency usage in financial applications
   * 
   * @param message - Human-readable notification content for user display
   * @param options - Configuration object specifying notification type and duration
