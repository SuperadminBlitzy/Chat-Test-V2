/**
 * Transaction Routes Module
 * 
 * This module defines the Express router for transaction-related endpoints in the
 * blockchain-based settlement network. It implements the API interface for Feature F-009
 * (Blockchain-based Settlement Network) and Feature F-012 (Settlement Reconciliation Engine)
 * as specified in section 2.1.3 of the technical requirements.
 * 
 * The router provides secure, validated, and auditable endpoints for transaction
 * creation and retrieval, supporting the complete transaction lifecycle from
 * initiation through blockchain settlement. All endpoints implement comprehensive
 * validation, error handling, and audit logging to meet regulatory compliance
 * requirements including SOX, PCI DSS, Basel III, and GDPR standards.
 * 
 * Architecture Features:
 * - Microservices-compatible routing with stateless design
 * - Enterprise-grade middleware integration for validation and authentication
 * - Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network integration for immutable records
 * - Real-time transaction processing with sub-second response targets
 * - Cross-border payment processing capabilities with multi-currency support
 * - Comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance and forensic analysis
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Input validation and sanitization through express-validator middleware
 * - JWT-based authentication and authorization (handled by auth middleware)
 * - Protection against injection attacks and data tampering
 * - Secure parameter handling with type safety enforcement
 * - Rate limiting and abuse prevention through API gateway integration
 * - Encrypted communication with blockchain network components
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Sub-second response times for transaction queries (<500ms target)
 * - High-throughput transaction processing (10,000+ TPS capability)
 * - Asynchronous processing for optimal resource utilization
 * - Connection pooling and resource optimization through controller layer
 * - Horizontal scaling support through stateless route design
 * - Circuit breaker patterns for resilient blockchain operations
 * 
 * Compliance Features:
 * - Immutable audit trails for all transaction operations
 * - Regulatory reporting support for financial authorities
 * - Data retention policies aligned with financial regulations
 * - Anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) integration
 * - Automated compliance validation and monitoring
 * - Risk assessment and fraud detection integration
 * 
 * Route Endpoints:
 * - POST /    : Create new blockchain transaction with validation
 * - GET /:id  : Retrieve specific transaction by unique identifier
 *
