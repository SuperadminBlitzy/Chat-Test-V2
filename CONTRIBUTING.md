## Git Workflow

We use a GitFlow-based branching model designed for financial services compliance:

### Branch Strategy

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine
2. **Create a feature branch** from the `develop` branch using descriptive names:
   - `feature/F-001-unified-data-integration`
   - `feature/F-004-digital-onboarding-form`
   - `bugfix/fix-risk-assessment-calculation`
   - `hotfix/security-patch-authentication`

3. **Commit your changes** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
   ```
   feat(F-001): implement real-time data synchronization
   fix(F-002): resolve AI model bias in risk assessment
   docs(contributing): update development setup guide
   security: patch authentication vulnerability
   ```

4. **Push your feature branch** to your fork
5. **Create a pull request** to the `develop` branch of the main repository

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Include security implications in security-related commits
