     * Default constructor for the Customer Service Application Tests.
     * 
     * This constructor is implicitly called by the JUnit 5 test framework during test initialization.
     * The Spring Boot Test framework handles the setup of the test context, including:
     * - Loading the full Spring application context
     * - Initializing all Spring Boot auto-configuration
     * - Setting up test-specific configurations and profiles
     * - Preparing mock or embedded services for testing
     * 
     * Test Context Configuration:
     * - @SpringBootTest annotation triggers full application context loading
     * - Spring Boot scans for @SpringBootApplication annotated main class
     * - Component scanning starts from the com.ufs.customer package
     * - Auto-configuration enables Spring Boot's opinionated defaults
     * - Test profiles can be activated using @ActiveProfiles if needed
     * - Test properties can override production configurations
     * 
     * Resource Management:
     * - Spring Test framework manages application context lifecycle
     * - Context is cached and reused across test methods for performance
     * - Database connections are managed by Spring's transaction management
     * - External service connections are properly closed after test completion

     * - Final validation of all critical components is performed
     * 
     * Failure Scenarios and Troubleshooting:
     * 
     * Common failure reasons and their implications:
     * 
     * 1. Bean Creation Failures:
     *    - Missing dependencies or circular dependencies
     *    - Incorrect configuration properties or invalid values
     *    - Database connection failures or invalid credentials
     *    - Resolution: Check application logs for specific bean creation errors
     * 
     * 2. Configuration Binding Errors:
     *    - Invalid YAML/Properties syntax in configuration files
     *    - Missing required configuration properties
     *    - Type conversion errors in property binding
     *    - Resolution: Validate configuration file syntax and required properties
     * 
     * 3. Database Connectivity Issues:
     *    - Database server unavailable or connection refused
     *    - Invalid database credentials or connection string
     *    - Database schema mismatch or missing tables
     *    - Resolution: Verify database availability and configuration
     * 
     * 4. Security Configuration Problems:
     *    - Invalid OAuth2 configuration or missing security properties
     *    - Certificate or key store configuration errors
     *    - Authentication provider setup failures
     *    - Resolution: Check security configuration and credentials
     * 
     * 5. Service Discovery Registration Failures:
     *    - Eureka server unavailable or incorrect configuration
     *    - Network connectivity issues to service registry
     *    - Invalid service metadata or registration parameters
     *    - Resolution: Verify Eureka server availability and configuration
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * 
     * - Context loading time should be under 30 seconds for acceptable test performance
     * - Database connection establishment should complete within 5 seconds
     * - Service discovery registration should succeed within 10 seconds
     * - Memory usage during context loading should remain within acceptable limits
     * 
     * Test Environment Setup:
     * 
     * For optimal test execution, ensure:
     * - Required databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are available (embedded or containerized)
     * - Kafka broker is available for event streaming tests
     * - Eureka server is running for service discovery tests
     * - Test configuration profiles are properly configured
     * - External service dependencies are mocked or available
     * 
     * Success Criteria:
     * 
     * This test passes when:
     * - Spring application context loads completely without exceptions
     * - All required beans are created and properly configured
     * - Database connections are successfully established
     * - Service discovery registration completes successfully
     * - Security configuration is properly initialized
     * - All actuator endpoints are accessible and functional
     * - Application is ready to serve requests and process events
     * 
     * Integration with CI/CD Pipeline:
     * 
     * This test serves as a critical gate in the deployment pipeline:
     * - Must pass before code can be merged to main branch
     * - Validates that application can start in target environments
     * - Provides early feedback on configuration and dependency issues
     * - Ensures that microservice can integrate with platform ecosystem
     * 
     * Monitoring and Alerting:
     * 
     * Test results should be monitored for:
     * - Consistent test execution time (performance regression detection)
     * - Failure patterns that might indicate environmental issues
     * - Memory or resource usage trends during context loading
     * - External dependency availability and reliability
     * 
     * @throws Exception if the Spring Boot application context fails to load due to:
     *                   - Configuration errors or missing required properties
     *                   - Database connectivity issues or invalid credentials
     *                   - Bean creation failures or circular dependencies
     *                   - Security configuration problems or invalid certificates
     *                   - Service discovery registration failures
     *                   - External service connectivity issues
     *                   - Resource allocation problems or insufficient memory

        // Test method implementation:
        // 
        // The @SpringBootTest annotation on the class level triggers the complete application
        // context loading process. When this test method is executed by JUnit 5:
        //
        // 1. Spring Boot Test framework creates a full application context
        // 2. CustomerServiceApplication.main() equivalent initialization occurs
        // 3. All @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller beans are created
        // 4. Database connections are established and validated
        // 5. Security configuration is initialized and validated
        // 6. Service discovery registration is attempted
        // 7. Event streaming connections are configured
        // 8. Actuator endpoints are exposed and made available
        // 9. Application context is marked as successfully loaded
        //
        // If any step in this process fails, the test will fail with a detailed exception
        // indicating the specific failure point and cause. The absence of any assertions
        // in this method is intentional - the success criterion is simply that the
        // application context loads without throwing any exceptions.
        //
        // This approach follows Spring Boot testing best practices where context loading
        // tests serve as integration smoke tests, validating that all components can be
        // initialized and wired together successfully.
        //
        // The test executes silently if successful, or throws detailed exceptions if
        // any part of the application initialization process fails, providing clear
        // feedback about configuration or integration issues.
        
        // No explicit assertions needed - successful context loading is the test criteria
        // If context loading fails, Spring Boot Test framework will throw detailed exceptions
        // indicating the specific failure point (bean creation, database connection, etc.)
