    /**
     * Initiates the comprehensive digital customer onboarding process.
     * 
     * This method serves as the primary entry point for new customer registration,
     * orchestrating a complex workflow that includes identity verification, 
     * compliance checks, risk assessment, and account creation processes.
     * 
     * The onboarding process consists of the following sequential steps:
     * 
     * 1. Request Validation & Processing:
     *    - Validates incoming onboarding request data integrity
     *    - Performs initial data sanitization and format verification
     *    - Ensures all required fields are present and properly formatted
     *    - Validates document URLs and accessibility for verification
     * 
     * 2. Customer Entity Creation:
     *    - Creates new customer entity with provided personal information
     *    - Generates unique customer identifier (UUID) for system-wide tracking
     *    - Establishes initial customer profile in PostgreSQL database
     *    - Sets up audit trail and compliance tracking records
     * 
     * 3. KYC/AML Verification Pipeline:
     *    - Initiates KYC checks through integrated KycService
     *    - Processes government-issued identity documents for authenticity
     *    - Performs document-to-person correlation verification
     *    - Executes AML screening against global watchlists and sanctions databases
     *    - Validates document expiry dates and jurisdiction compliance
     * 
     * 4. Risk Assessment Integration:
     *    - Triggers comprehensive risk assessment through RiskAssessmentService
     *    - Analyzes customer profile against risk scoring algorithms
     *    - Evaluates geographic risk factors and regulatory implications
     *    - Calculates dynamic risk score using AI/ML models
     *    - Determines appropriate service levels and monitoring requirements
     * 
     * 5. Biometric Verification (if applicable):
     *    - Processes biometric data for identity authentication
     *    - Performs liveness detection and facial recognition analysis
     *    - Correlates biometric data with identity document photos
     *    - Validates authenticity using AI-powered verification algorithms
     * 
     * 6. Compliance Status Determination:
     *    - Aggregates results from all verification processes
     *    - Determines overall onboarding status based on compliance requirements
     *    - Creates comprehensive onboarding status record with step-by-step tracking
     *    - Generates audit logs for regulatory reporting requirements
     * 
     * 7. Response Generation:
     *    - Constructs detailed onboarding response with current status
     *    - Includes customer information for successful onboarding attempts
     *    - Provides clear messaging for next steps or required actions
     *    - Sets appropriate timestamps for performance tracking
     * 
     * Business Logic & Validation Rules:
     * ===================================
     * - Customer must be 18+ years old for account opening eligibility
     * - All identity documents must be valid (not expired) at time of submission
     * - Personal information must correlate with government-issued ID data
     * - Address information must be verifiable against proof of address documents
     * - Phone number and email must be unique within the platform
     * - High-risk customers require additional verification steps and manual review
     * - Certain geographic locations may require enhanced due diligence procedures
     * 
     * Error Handling Strategy:
     * ========================
     * - Validation errors return detailed field-specific error messages
     * - External service failures trigger retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
     * - Document verification failures provide clear guidance for resubmission
     * - System errors are logged comprehensively while protecting customer PII
     * - Partial failures allow for resume capability without complete restart
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * ============================
     * - Average processing time: 2-5 minutes for standard onboarding
     * - Real-time status updates during processing for enhanced user experience
     * - Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operation execution
     * - Optimized database queries for minimal latency impact
     * - Efficient memory management for high-throughput scenarios
     * 
     * Security Measures:
     * ==================
     * - All customer PII encrypted in transit and at rest
     * - Secure document storage with time-limited access tokens
     * - Comprehensive audit logging without exposing sensitive data
     * - Role-based access control for onboarding process management
     * - Secure communication with external verification services
     * 
     * Integration Patterns:
     * =====================
     * - Event-driven architecture for real-time status updates
     * - Circuit breaker patterns for external service resilience
     * - Compensating transaction patterns for rollback capabilities
     * - Saga pattern implementation for distributed transaction management
     * - API rate limiting and throttling for external service compliance
