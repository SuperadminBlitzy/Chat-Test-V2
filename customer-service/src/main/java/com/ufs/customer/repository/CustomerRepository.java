/**
 * CustomerRepository - Enterprise Data Access Layer for Customer Management
 * 
 * This Spring Data JPA repository interface serves as the primary data access component
 * for Customer entities within the Unified Financial Services Platform. It provides
 * comprehensive CRUD operations and specialized query methods to support critical
 * business features including Unified Data Integration (F-001) and Digital Customer
 * Onboarding (F-004).
 * 
 * Business Context:
 * - Supports sub-second response times as required by platform performance specifications
 * - Enables 10,000+ TPS capacity through optimized database queries and indexing
 * - Facilitates unified customer profile management across all financial touchpoints
 * - Provides data access patterns for digital onboarding workflows achieving <5 minutes completion
 * - Supports KYC/AML compliance through efficient customer data retrieval and management
 * 
 * Technical Architecture:
 * - Extends JpaRepository<Customer, UUID> for comprehensive CRUD functionality
 * - Leverages PostgreSQL 16+ advanced features for optimal query performance
 * - Implements custom query methods using Spring Data JPA query derivation
 * - Provides native SQL queries for complex business logic requirements
 * - Supports transaction management for data consistency and integrity
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Optimized queries with database-level indexing for fast customer lookups
 * - Efficient pagination support for large customer datasets
 * - Batch operations for bulk customer data processing during integration
 * - Connection pooling optimization for high-concurrency scenarios
 * - Query result caching strategies for frequently accessed customer data
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
 * - Role-based access control integration through Spring Security
 * - Audit-friendly method signatures for compliance tracking
 * - Secure handling of personally identifiable information (PII)
 * 
 * Compliance Support:
 * - Enables Customer Identification Programme (CIP) data retrieval
 * - Supports Customer Due Diligence (CDD) information access
 * - Facilitates AML screening and watchlist verification processes
 * - Provides audit trail support for regulatory reporting requirements
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - CustomerProfile: MongoDB document relationships through customer ID mapping
 * - KycDocument: One-to-many relationship support for compliance documentation

     * Find Customer by Email Address
     * 
     * Retrieves a customer record based on their unique email address. This method
     * is essential for customer authentication, account access, and duplicate prevention
     * during the digital onboarding process. Email serves as a primary business identifier
     * for customer communication and account management.
     * 
     * Business Applications:
     * - Customer login and authentication workflows
     * - Duplicate account prevention during onboarding
     * - Password reset and account recovery processes
     * - Customer service support and account identification
     * - Marketing communication and preference management
     * 
     * Performance Optimization:
     * - Leverages database index on email column for sub-second response times
     * - Returns Optional to handle null cases gracefully without exceptions
     * - Supports efficient EXISTS queries for email validation workflows
     * - Optimized for high-frequency usage during authentication operations
     * 
     * Security Considerations:
     * - Email parameter validation to prevent injection attacks
     * - Case-insensitive search for improved user experience
     * - Audit logging for account access tracking and security monitoring
     * - Compliance with privacy regulations for email-based customer identification
     * 
     * Usage Examples:
     * - Digital onboarding: Check if email already exists before account creation
     * - Authentication: Validate customer credentials during login process
     * - Customer service: Locate customer account for support inquiries
     * - Compliance: Verify customer identity for KYC/AML processes

     * Performance Benefits:
     * - Faster execution than findByEmail when only existence matters
     * - Reduced memory usage by avoiding object instantiation
     * - Optimized for high-frequency validation operations
