/**
 * OnboardingStatusRepository - Spring Data JPA Repository Interface
 * 
 * This repository interface provides comprehensive data access operations for OnboardingStatus entities
 * within the customer-service microservice of the Unified Financial Services Platform. It leverages
 * Spring Data JPA's advanced query capabilities to support the Digital Customer Onboarding (F-004)
 * and Unified Data Integration Platform (F-001) requirements.
 * 
 * Business Context:
 * - Supports digital customer onboarding workflow tracking and status management
 * - Enables real-time monitoring of KYC/AML compliance progress for regulatory reporting
 * - Facilitates AI-powered risk assessment by providing onboarding status data
 * - Ensures audit trail completeness for compliance and regulatory investigations
 * - Supports sub-5-minute onboarding time requirement through optimized data access
 * 
 * Technical Architecture:
 * - Extends JpaRepository<OnboardingStatus, Long> for standard CRUD operations
 * - Utilizes Spring Data JPA's query derivation for automatic implementation
 * - Supports complex queries through @Query annotations for custom business logic
 * - Implements lazy loading strategies for optimal performance with large datasets
 * - Provides transaction management through Spring's declarative transaction support
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Optimized for 10,000+ TPS capacity as per platform requirements
 * - Leverages PostgreSQL 16+ database indexes for sub-second query response times
 * - Implements connection pooling (20 primary, 15 read-replica connections)
 * - Supports read-replica queries for analytics and reporting operations
 * - Uses prepared statements for SQL injection prevention and query optimization
 * 
 * Compliance Features:
 * - Supports Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) onboarding status reporting requirements
 * - Enables Customer Identification Programme (CIP) progress tracking
 * - Facilitates Customer Due Diligence (CDD) workflow status monitoring
 * - Provides complete audit trails for regulatory compliance and investigations
 * - Supports real-time compliance status updates for automated workflows
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Used by OnboardingService for workflow orchestration and status management
 * - Integrates with ComplianceService for regulatory status tracking and reporting
 * - Supports AI/ML services for risk assessment and onboarding optimization
 * - Enables real-time analytics through metrics collection and monitoring
 * - Facilitates audit logging through comprehensive status change tracking
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Repository operations are secured through Spring Security method-level security
 * - Supports audit logging for all data access operations and modifications
 * - Implements row-level security for multi-tenant customer data isolation
 * - Ensures data integrity through JPA validation and database constraints
 * - Supports encryption at rest for sensitive onboarding status information
 * 
 * Query Optimization:
 * - Leverages database indexes on customer_id, overall_status, and timestamps
 * - Implements query hints for optimal execution plan selection
 * - Supports batch operations for bulk status updates and reporting
 * - Uses projection interfaces for lightweight data transfer objects
 * - Implements caching strategies for frequently accessed status information
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Comprehensive exception handling for database connectivity issues
 * - Graceful degradation for read-replica connection failures
 * - Retry mechanisms for transient database connection problems
 * - Detailed error logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
 * - Circuit breaker patterns for external dependency failures
