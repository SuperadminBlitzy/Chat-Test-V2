/**
 * OnboardingResponse DTO - Data Transfer Object for Customer Onboarding Response
 * 
 * This class represents the structured response of a customer digital onboarding process
 * as defined in F-004: Digital Customer Onboarding feature specification. It provides
 * comprehensive feedback on the onboarding attempt status, progress details, and
 * customer information upon successful completion.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Standardized response format for onboarding operations across microservices
 * - Support for KYC/AML compliance reporting and status tracking
 * - Real-time onboarding progress communication to client applications
 * - Integration with AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine results
 * - Comprehensive audit trail support for regulatory compliance
 * 
 * Business Requirements Addressed:
 * F-004-RQ-001: Digital identity verification response feedback
 * F-004-RQ-002: KYC/AML compliance status communication
 * F-004-RQ-003: Biometric authentication result reporting
 * F-004-RQ-004: Risk-based onboarding process status updates
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Optimized for <5 minutes average onboarding time requirement
 * - Lightweight serialization for API responses (JSON/XML)
 * - Thread-safe immutable structure for high-concurrency scenarios
 * - Efficient memory footprint for 10,000+ TPS system requirements
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Contains customer PII - ensure proper encryption in transit and at rest
 * - Implements data masking for sensitive information in logs
 * - Supports GDPR compliance with controlled customer data exposure
 * - Maintains audit trail integrity for regulatory reporting
 * 
 * Compliance Alignment:
 * - Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) onboarding status reporting
 * - International KYC/AML compliance result communication
 * - Customer Identification Programme (CIP) status tracking
 * - Customer Due Diligence (CDD) process result reporting
 * - SOC2 and PCI DSS audit trail compliance
 * 
 * Integration Context:
 * - Unified Data Integration Platform (F-001) data model compliance
 * - AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine (F-002) result integration
 * - Regulatory Compliance Automation (F-003) status reporting
 * - Real-time event streaming for downstream system notification
