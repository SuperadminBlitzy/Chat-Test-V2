/**
 * Main entry point for the Customer Service microservice within the Unified Financial Services Platform.
 * 
 * This service is a core component of the data integration platform (F-001), responsible for managing
 * customer data across the enterprise. It also handles customer data aspects of the digital onboarding
 * process (F-004), providing essential customer management capabilities for the financial services ecosystem.
 * 
 * The Customer Service is designed to:
 * - Provide unified customer profile management across all touchpoints
 * - Support real-time data synchronization within 5 seconds (F-001-RQ-001)
 * - Enable digital identity verification for onboarding (F-004-RQ-001)
 * - Maintain data quality validation with 99.5% accuracy (F-001-RQ-003)
 * - Support KYC/AML compliance checks (F-004-RQ-002)
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Built on Spring Boot 3.2+ for enterprise-grade microservices foundation
 * - Integrates with Spring Cloud 2023.0+ for service discovery and configuration management
 * - Registers with Eureka discovery service for seamless microservices communication
 * - Designed for horizontal scalability to support 10,000+ TPS capacity
 * - Ensures sub-second response times for 99% of customer data operations
 * 
 * Security & Compliance:
 * - Implements SOC2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR compliance requirements
 * - Supports role-based access control with comprehensive audit trails
 * - Enables end-to-end encryption for customer data protection
 * - Maintains regulatory compliance for financial services sector
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Connects with PostgreSQL for transactional customer data storage
 * - Integrates with MongoDB for customer interaction analytics
 * - Supports real-time event streaming via Apache Kafka
 * - Provides RESTful APIs following financial industry standards (ISO20022, SWIFT)
 * 
 * Performance Targets:
 * - Response time: <1 second for customer data operations
 * - Availability: 99.99% uptime with comprehensive disaster recovery
 * - Scalability: Horizontal scaling capable of supporting 10x growth
 * - Data sync: Real-time synchronization across all connected sources within 5 seconds

     * Main method serving as the entry point for the Customer Service microservice.
     * 
     * This method bootstraps the Spring Boot application using SpringApplication.run(),
     * which initializes the Spring ApplicationContext, starts the embedded web server,
     * and registers the service with the discovery server (Eureka).
     * 
     * The application startup process includes:
     * 1. Loading application configuration from application.yml/properties
     * 2. Initializing Spring Boot auto-configuration
     * 3. Setting up database connections (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
     * 4. Configuring security components (OAuth2, JWT)
     * 5. Starting embedded Tomcat server on configured port
     * 6. Registering with Eureka discovery service
     * 7. Exposing health check and metrics endpoints
     * 8. Initializing Kafka event streaming connections
     * 
     * Environment-specific configurations:
     * - Development: Local database connections, debug logging
     * - Staging: Integration test databases, detailed metrics
     * - Production: Clustered databases, optimized performance settings
     * 
     * Health Check Endpoints:
     * - /actuator/health: Service health status
     * - /actuator/info: Service information and version
     * - /actuator/metrics: Performance and operational metrics
     * - /actuator/prometheus: Prometheus-compatible metrics export
     * 
     * @param args Command-line arguments passed to the application.
     *             These can include Spring profiles, configuration overrides,
     *             and environment-specific parameters such as:
     *             --spring.profiles.active=production
     *             --server.port=8080
     *             --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://...
