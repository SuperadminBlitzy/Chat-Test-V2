/**
 * Main integration test class for the Risk Assessment Service application.
 * 
 * This class is responsible for running integration tests that require the full Spring
 * application context to be loaded. It serves as the foundational test to ensure that
 * the AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine (F-002) can be successfully initialized and
 * all components are correctly configured and wired together.
 * 
 * Business Context:
 * The Risk Assessment Service is a critical component of the Unified Financial Services
 * Platform that provides:
 * - Real-time risk scoring with sub-500ms response times
 * - Predictive risk modeling using machine learning algorithms
 * - Fraud detection and anomaly identification
 * - Risk mitigation recommendations with explainable AI
 * - Integration with unified data platform for comprehensive risk analysis
 * 
 * Technical Context:
 * This integration test validates the fundamental stability of the microservice by:
 * - Verifying Spring Boot application context can be successfully loaded
 * - Ensuring all auto-configuration classes are properly initialized
 * - Validating service discovery registration (@EnableDiscoveryClient)
 * - Confirming all required beans are created and dependency injection works
 * - Testing basic application health and readiness
 * 
 * Test Strategy:
 * The test uses Spring Boot's @SpringBootTest annotation to bootstrap the complete
 * application context, which includes:
 * - All Spring beans and components
 * - Auto-configuration classes
 * - Database connections and connection pools
 * - Service discovery client registration
 * - Security configuration
 * - Actuator endpoints for monitoring
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - This test loads the full Spring context, which may take several seconds
 * - Test is designed to run quickly in CI/CD pipelines
 * - Uses test profile to avoid external dependencies during testing
 * - Implements proper resource cleanup after test execution
 * 
 * Compliance Requirements:
 * This test ensures the service meets regulatory compliance requirements by:
 * - Validating secure initialization of the application
 * - Ensuring audit logging capabilities are available
 * - Confirming explainable AI components are properly loaded
 * - Verifying data protection mechanisms are in place

     * Integration test to verify that the Spring application context loads successfully.
     * 
     * This is a fundamental integration test that ensures the AI-Powered Risk Assessment
     * Engine can be properly initialized and all required components are correctly
     * configured. The test validates that:
     * 
     * Application Context Loading:
     * - Spring Boot can successfully bootstrap the application
     * - All auto-configuration classes are properly executed
     * - Component scanning discovers and registers all beans
     * - Dependency injection resolves all required dependencies
     * - No circular dependencies or configuration conflicts exist
     * 
     * Service Discovery Integration:
     * - @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation is processed correctly
     * - Service registration configuration is valid (disabled in test profile)
     * - Health check endpoints are properly configured
     * 
     * Database Integration:
     * - Database connection configuration is valid
     * - JPA entities and repositories are properly initialized
     * - Connection pooling is configured correctly
     * - Schema creation and validation succeeds
     * 
     * Security Configuration:
     * - Spring Security configuration is properly loaded
     * - Authentication and authorization components are initialized
     * - Security filters and handlers are correctly configured
     * 
     * Actuator and Monitoring:
     * - Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are properly configured
     * - Health indicators are registered and functional
     * - Metrics collection is properly initialized
     * - Application info endpoint is available
     * 
     * AI/ML Model Integration:
     * - Machine learning model loading infrastructure is initialized
     * - Risk assessment algorithm components are properly configured
     * - Fraud detection system components are available
     * - Explainable AI components are properly loaded
     * 
     * Test Methodology:
     * The test method is intentionally left empty because the @SpringBootTest annotation
     * triggers the complete application context loading process. If any component fails
     * to initialize properly, Spring Boot will throw an exception and the test will fail.
     * This approach follows the "fail-fast" principle - if the application cannot start
     * successfully, there's no point in running more detailed tests.
     * 
     * Success Criteria:
     * - No exceptions thrown during application context initialization
     * - All required beans are successfully created and configured
     * - Service discovery client is properly initialized (when enabled)
     * - Database connections are established successfully
     * - Security configuration is loaded without errors
     * - Actuator endpoints are available and responsive
     * 
     * Failure Scenarios:
     * This test will fail if:
     * - Missing or invalid configuration properties
     * - Circular dependency issues between components
     * - Database connection problems
     * - Missing required dependencies or libraries
     * - Invalid Spring configuration classes
     * - Security configuration errors
     * - Service discovery registration failures (when enabled)
     * 
     * Performance Expectations:
     * - Context loading should complete within 30 seconds in CI/CD environment
     * - Memory usage should remain within acceptable limits during initialization
     * - No resource leaks should occur during context startup
     * 
     * @throws Exception if the Spring application context fails to load successfully
     *                   or if any required component fails to initialize properly
