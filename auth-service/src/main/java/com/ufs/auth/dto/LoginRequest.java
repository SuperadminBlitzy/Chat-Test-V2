/**
 * Data Transfer Object (DTO) for user authentication login requests.
 * 
 * This class encapsulates the user's credentials (username and password) required
 * for authentication within the Digital Customer Onboarding (F-004) feature and
 * serves as the primary data structure for initiating OAuth2 authentication flows
 * to obtain JWT tokens.
 * 
 * The class implements comprehensive validation to ensure security compliance
 * for financial services, preventing null or empty credential submissions that
 * could compromise the authentication process.
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Input validation using Jakarta Bean Validation
 * - Prevents injection attacks through proper validation constraints
 * - Supports audit logging for compliance requirements
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Used by authentication endpoints for login processing
 * - Integrates with OAuth2 flow for JWT token generation
 * - Supports KYC/AML compliance checks during authentication
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Lightweight DTO for high-throughput authentication scenarios
 * - Optimized for sub-second response times (<500ms requirement)
 * - Memory efficient for 10,000+ TPS capacity

 * @since 1.0.0
