/**
 * Spring Data JPA repository interface for managing User entities in the unified financial services platform.
 * 
 * This repository serves as the primary data access layer for the User entity, providing comprehensive
 * database operations required for:
 * - Digital Customer Onboarding (F-004) processes including KYC/AML compliance
 * - Authentication and Authorization services across the platform
 * - User account management and verification workflows
 * - Regulatory compliance and audit trail requirements
 * 
 * The repository extends JpaRepository to leverage Spring Data JPA's powerful features including:
 * - Automatic CRUD operations with optimized SQL generation
 * - Transaction management with ACID compliance for financial data integrity
 * - Query method derivation from method names for type-safe database access
 * - Support for custom JPQL queries for complex business requirements
 * - Integration with Spring Security for seamless authentication workflows
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Thread-safe operations suitable for high-concurrency financial environments
 * - Optimized query performance for sub-second response times (< 500ms target)
 * - Support for PostgreSQL-specific optimizations and indexing strategies
 * - Comprehensive error handling with Optional return types to prevent null pointer exceptions
 * - Audit-friendly method signatures supporting compliance and regulatory requirements
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - All database operations are executed within Spring's transactional context
 * - Sensitive user data is handled according to financial industry security standards
 * - Repository methods support role-based access control (RBAC) through Spring Security integration
 * - Query results are filtered based on user permissions and data access policies
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Designed to handle 10,000+ transactions per second (TPS) as per system requirements
 * - Optimized for PostgreSQL 16+ with appropriate indexing on username and email columns
 * - Connection pooling support for efficient resource utilization
 * - Query caching enabled for frequently accessed user profiles
 * 
 * Compliance & Regulatory Support:
 * - Supports KYC (Know Your Customer) data retrieval requirements
 * - Enables AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance through user identification methods
 * - Provides audit trail capabilities for regulatory reporting
 * - Maintains data integrity standards required for financial services

     * Retrieves a user by their unique username.
     * 
     * This method is essential for the authentication process, enabling the system to:
     * - Locate user accounts during login attempts
     * - Validate username uniqueness during registration
     * - Support username-based authentication flows
     * - Enable account recovery and password reset workflows
     * 
     * The method is optimized for the authentication service's core requirement to retrieve
     * user details based on the provided username credential. It integrates seamlessly with
     * Spring Security's UserDetailsService implementation.
     * 
     * Database Optimization:
     * - Leverages unique index on the username column for O(log n) lookup performance
     * - Returns Optional to handle non-existent users gracefully without exceptions
     * - Supports case-sensitive username matching as per security requirements
     * - Optimized SQL generation: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?
     * 
     * Security Features:
     * - Prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries
     * - Supports audit logging of username lookup attempts
     * - Compatible with rate limiting for brute force attack prevention
     * - Enables account lockout mechanisms based on failed lookup patterns
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Target response time: < 50ms for 99% of requests
     * - Supports concurrent access with proper isolation levels
     * - Efficient memory usage with lazy loading of associated collections
     * - Database connection pooling for optimal resource utilization
     * 
     * Use Cases:
     * - User authentication during login process
     * - Username availability checking during registration
     * - Account recovery and password reset workflows
     * - Administrative user lookup operations
     * - Compliance reporting and audit trail generation
     * 
     * Integration Points:
     * - Spring Security UserDetailsService implementation
     * - Digital Customer Onboarding (F-004) user verification
     * - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) user identification
     * - Fraud detection system user profile retrieval

     * @param username The unique username to search for. Must not be null or empty.
     *                 Username matching is case-sensitive and exact match only.
     *                 Special characters and Unicode are supported as per platform requirements.
     * 
     * @return Optional<User> containing the User entity if found, or empty Optional if no user
     *         exists with the specified username. Never returns null to prevent NullPointerException.
     *         
     * @throws org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException if database access fails
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if username parameter is null

    /**
     * Retrieves a user by their email address.
     * 
     * This method supports various user management scenarios including:
     * - Email-based authentication as an alternative to username
