/**
 * Integration test suite for the ConfigServerApplication within the Unified Financial Services Platform.
 * 
 * <p>This test class validates the proper initialization and startup of the Spring Cloud Configuration Server,
 * which serves as the centralized configuration management service for all microservices in the distributed
 * financial services ecosystem. The config server is a critical component that must be operational before
 * any dependent microservices can start successfully.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The integration tests in this class ensure that:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Spring Boot application context loads without errors</li>
 *     <li>Spring Cloud Config Server components are properly initialized</li>
 *     <li>All necessary beans and auto-configurations are loaded</li>
 *     <li>Configuration repository connections are established</li>
 *     <li>RESTful configuration endpoints are available</li>
 *     <li>Health check endpoints are functional</li>
 *     <li>Security configurations are properly applied</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Test Environment Considerations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Uses embedded test configuration to avoid external dependencies</li>
 *     <li>Validates core functionality without requiring external Git repositories</li>
 *     <li>Ensures rapid feedback for CI/CD pipeline integration</li>
 *     <li>Supports both local development and automated testing environments</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Business Impact:</p>
 * The configuration server is fundamental to the platform's microservices architecture, supporting
 * requirements for centralized configuration management, environment-specific configurations,
 * and dynamic configuration updates as specified in F-001 (Unified Data Integration Platform).
 * Failure of this service would impact the entire financial services platform's ability to
 * maintain consistent configuration across distributed systems.
 * 
 * <p>Compliance and Security:</p>
 * This test validates that the configuration server starts with appropriate security configurations
 * required for financial services environments, including proper Spring Security setup and
 * encrypted configuration capabilities for sensitive financial data.

     * Integration test method that validates the successful loading of the Spring application context
     * for the ConfigServerApplication.
     * 
     * <p>This test method performs comprehensive validation of the configuration server startup process,
     * ensuring that all critical components are properly initialized and ready to serve configuration
     * requests to client microservices in the financial services platform.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Test Coverage:</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li><strong>Application Context Loading:</strong> Verifies Spring Boot application context
     *         initializes without throwing exceptions</li>
     *     <li><strong>Auto-Configuration Validation:</strong> Ensures Spring Boot auto-configuration
     *         properly sets up all necessary beans and components</li>
     *     <li><strong>Config Server Initialization:</strong> Validates @EnableConfigServer annotation
     *         properly configures Spring Cloud Config Server functionality</li>
     *     <li><strong>Embedded Web Server:</strong> Confirms embedded Tomcat server starts successfully
     *         and is ready to accept HTTP requests</li>
     *     <li><strong>Configuration Endpoints:</strong> Implicitly validates that configuration
     *         REST endpoints are available and properly configured</li>
     *     <li><strong>Security Configuration:</strong> Ensures Spring Security configurations
     *         are properly applied for financial services compliance</li>
     *     <li><strong>Health Check Endpoints:</strong> Validates actuator health endpoints
     *         are available for monitoring and alerting</li>
     *     <li><strong>Bean Dependency Resolution:</strong> Confirms all required dependencies
     *         are properly injected and available</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Expected Behavior:</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Application context loads without exceptions</li>
     *     <li>All Spring Boot auto-configurations complete successfully</li>
     *     <li>Configuration server endpoints become available</li>
     *     <li>Health check endpoints respond appropriately</li>
     *     <li>Security configurations are properly applied</li>
     *     <li>All required beans are created and initialized</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Failure Scenarios:</p>
     * This test will fail if any of the following conditions occur:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Spring Boot application context fails to load due to configuration errors</li>
     *     <li>Missing or incompatible dependencies prevent proper initialization</li>
     *     <li>Port conflicts prevent embedded web server from starting</li>
     *     <li>Security configuration errors block application startup</li>
     *     <li>Invalid Spring Cloud Config Server configuration</li>
     *     <li>Bean creation or dependency injection failures</li>
     *     <li>Configuration repository connection issues (if external repos configured)</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Integration with CI/CD Pipeline:</p>
     * This test is critical for the continuous integration pipeline as it validates
     * that the configuration server can start successfully in various environments:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Local development environments</li>
     *     <li>CI/CD build environments</li>
     *     <li>Staging and production deployment validation</li>
     *     <li>Container-based deployment scenarios</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Platform Dependencies Validated:</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Java 21 LTS compatibility and features</li>
     *     <li>Spring Boot 3.2+ framework integration</li>
     *     <li>Spring Cloud 2023.0+ configuration server functionality</li>
     *     <li>Spring Security 6.2+ security framework</li>
     *     <li>Embedded Tomcat web server configuration</li>
     *     <li>Actuator health check and monitoring endpoints</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Financial Services Compliance:</p>
     * By ensuring the configuration server starts correctly, this test indirectly validates
     * that security configurations required for financial services environments are properly
     * applied, including:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Encrypted configuration storage capabilities</li>
     *     <li>Secure HTTP endpoint configuration</li>
     *     <li>Role-based access control setup</li>
     *     <li>Audit logging configuration</li>
     *     <li>Compliance with financial industry security standards</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Performance Implications:</p>
     * This test validates that the configuration server can start within acceptable time limits
     * to meet the platform's performance requirements of sub-second response times and
     * high availability (99.99% uptime) for critical financial services infrastructure.
