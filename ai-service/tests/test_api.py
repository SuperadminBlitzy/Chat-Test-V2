AI Service API Integration Tests

This module contains comprehensive integration tests for the AI service API endpoints,
validating the functionality of AI-powered financial services including risk assessment,
fraud detection, and personalized recommendations. The tests use FastAPI TestClient
to send requests to the API and verify that responses meet enterprise requirements.

Features Tested:
- F-002: AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine - Real-time risk scoring and categorization
- F-006: Fraud Detection System - Transaction fraud analysis and scoring  
- F-007: Personalized Financial Recommendations - Customer-specific financial advice

Test Coverage:
- Request validation and data serialization/deserialization
- API response formats and status codes
- Business logic validation for risk scores and fraud detection
- Performance requirements verification
- Error handling and edge cases
- Compliance with financial services standards

Technical Requirements:
- FastAPI TestClient 0.104.1 for API testing
- Pytest 7.4.0 for test framework and fixtures
- Comprehensive test data covering various risk profiles and scenarios
- Enterprise-grade assertions and validation

    Tests the /api/v1/ai/recommendations endpoint for personalized financial recommendations.
    
    This test validates the F-007 Personalized Financial Recommendations feature by
    sending a request for customer-specific financial advice and verifying that the
    system generates relevant, personalized recommendations based on customer profile
    analysis and behavioral patterns.
    
    Test Scenario:
    - Valid customer ID with established financial profile
    - Request for personalized financial recommendations
    - Expected multiple recommendation categories
    
    Expected Results:
    - HTTP 200 OK status code
    - Non-empty list of personalized recommendations
    - Each recommendation contains required fields and valid data
    - Response time within SLA requirements (<1 second)
