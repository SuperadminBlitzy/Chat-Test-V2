AI Service - Services Package Initialization

This module initializes the 'services' package for the AI service, making key service classes
available at the package level for easier access by other modules within the AI service.
This initialization module promotes a cleaner package structure by exposing the core service
classes that implement critical financial AI features.

Features Addressed:
- F-002: AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine (2.2.2 F-002: AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine)
  Real-time risk scoring and predictive risk modeling with <500ms response time requirements
  and 95% accuracy targets for comprehensive financial risk assessment.

- F-006: Fraud Detection System (2.1.2 AI and Analytics Features) 
  Real-time transaction fraud analysis with binary classification and probability scoring
  to identify and prevent fraudulent financial transactions with high precision.

- F-007: Personalized Financial Recommendations (2.1.2 AI and Analytics Features)
  Customer-specific financial advice and product recommendations based on behavioral
  patterns, financial goals, and risk profiles for enhanced customer experience.

Technical Architecture:
The services package implements a sophisticated AI/ML architecture using:
- TensorFlow 2.15+ for deep learning model execution and neural network inference
- Python 3.12 with FastAPI framework for high-performance API endpoints
- Enterprise-grade singleton pattern for optimal memory utilization and model reuse
- Comprehensive audit logging and compliance features for financial regulations
- Real-time prediction capabilities with sub-second response time requirements

Package Structure:
This __init__.py module exposes three core service classes:
1. FraudDetectionService: Implements F-006 fraud detection with real-time analysis
2. PredictionService: Implements F-002 risk assessment with ML model management  
3. RecommendationService: Implements F-007 personalized recommendations with AI

Enterprise Features:
- Production-ready error handling and graceful degradation strategies
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails and regulatory compliance (SOC2, PCI DSS, GDPR)
- Memory-optimized singleton pattern for model loading and inference
- Thread-safe operations supporting high-concurrency financial workloads
- Performance monitoring with metrics collection for SLA compliance

Security & Compliance:
- GDPR Article 22 compliance with explainable AI for automated decision-making
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance for financial data protection during processing
- SOC2 Type II controls for data security and availability requirements
- Basel III/IV regulatory framework support for risk management standards
- End-to-end encryption and secure model inference pipelines

Dependencies:
- TensorFlow 2.15.0: Google's machine learning framework for model execution
- NumPy 1.26.0: Numerical computing library for data operations and preprocessing
- Pandas 2.1.0: Data manipulation and analysis for transaction and customer data
- FastAPI 0.104+: High-performance web framework for API development
- Scikit-learn 1.3+: Traditional machine learning algorithms and preprocessing

Performance Requirements:
- Risk Assessment (F-002): <500ms response time for 99% of requests, 95% accuracy
- Fraud Detection (F-006): <200ms response time for real-time transaction processing
- Recommendations (F-007): <500ms response time for personalized recommendation generation
- System Availability: 99.9% uptime SLA with horizontal scaling capabilities
- Throughput: 10,000+ concurrent requests per second across all services
