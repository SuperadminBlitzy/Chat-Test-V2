AI Service Prediction Service

This service is responsible for loading and serving predictions from the various AI/ML models,
including risk assessment, fraud detection, and financial recommendations. It is designed as
a singleton to ensure that models are loaded only once into memory, optimizing performance
and resource usage.

Features Addressed:
- F-002: AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine - Real-time risk scoring and predictive modeling
- F-006: Fraud Detection System - Transaction fraud analysis with real-time scoring
- F-007: Personalized Financial Recommendations - Customer-specific financial advice

Technical Requirements:
- Singleton pattern for memory optimization and model reuse
- Sub-500ms response time for risk assessment (F-002 requirement)
- Real-time fraud detection capabilities (F-006 requirement)
- Personalized recommendation generation (F-007 requirement)
- Enterprise-grade error handling and logging
- Comprehensive data validation and preprocessing

Dependencies:
- TensorFlow 2.15.0 for deep learning model execution
- NumPy 1.26.0 for numerical operations and data preprocessing
- Internal configuration module for model paths and settings
- Model helpers for standardized model loading operations
- API models for request/response validation and serialization

class PredictionService:
    """
    A singleton class to manage AI model loading and prediction serving.
    
    This class implements the singleton pattern to ensure that machine learning models
    are loaded only once during service initialization, optimizing memory usage and
    startup performance. It manages three core AI models for financial services:
    
    1. Risk Assessment Model (F-002): Provides real-time risk scoring and predictive
       risk modeling with <500ms response time and 95% accuracy requirements.
    
    2. Fraud Detection Model (F-006): Performs real-time transaction fraud analysis
       with binary classification and probability scoring for risk assessment.
    
    3. Recommendation Model (F-007): Generates personalized financial recommendations
       based on customer profiles and behavioral patterns.
    
    Enterprise Features:
    - Singleton pattern for memory optimization and model reuse
    - Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
    - Audit logging for all prediction operations and model access
    - Input validation and sanitization for security compliance
    - Model performance monitoring and health checks
    - Support for model hot-swapping and version management
    
    Technical Implementation:
    - Models are loaded during initialization using standardized model helpers
    - Preprocessing pipelines ensure consistent data formatting
    - Post-processing pipelines format outputs to API response standards
    - Thread-safe operations for concurrent request handling
    - Memory-efficient prediction serving with caching capabilities
    
    Regulatory Compliance:
    - Explainable AI support for regulatory transparency requirements
    - Audit trail generation for all prediction operations
    - Data privacy protection with minimal data retention
    - Model governance and version control for compliance reporting

        This constructor loads the three core AI models from the paths specified in
        the configuration module. Models are loaded only once during the first
        initialization, and subsequent calls to __init__ are ignored due to the
        singleton pattern implementation.
        
        The initialization process includes:
        1. Loading the risk assessment model for F-002 requirements
        2. Loading the fraud detection model for F-006 requirements  
        3. Loading the recommendation model for F-007 requirements
        4. Validating model loading success and logging results
        5. Setting up model metadata for performance monitoring
        
        Model Loading Process:
        - Uses standardized model_helpers.load_model function for consistency

        - Provides fallback strategies for model loading failures
        - Logs detailed information for audit trails and debugging

        - Models are loaded synchronously during initialization
        - Memory usage is optimized through single model instance sharing

# Create the singleton instance of PredictionService

def get_prediction_service() -> PredictionService:
    """
    Returns the singleton instance of the PredictionService.
    
    This function provides dependency injection support for the FastAPI application
    and other parts of the AI service that need access to the prediction capabilities.
    It ensures that all consumers use the same model instances, optimizing memory
    usage and maintaining consistency across the application.
    
    Enterprise Features:
    - Singleton pattern implementation for resource optimization
    - Thread-safe access to the prediction service instance
    - Lazy initialization support for testing and development environments
    - Health check integration for service availability monitoring
    - Graceful degradation support when models are unavailable
    
    Usage in FastAPI Dependencies:
    ```python
    from fastapi import Depends
    
    @app.post("/api/v1/risk-assessment")
    async def assess_risk(
        request: RiskAssessmentRequest,
        prediction_service: PredictionService = Depends(get_prediction_service)
    ):
        return prediction_service.predict_risk(request)
    ```
    
    Returns:
        PredictionService: The singleton instance of the PredictionService containing
                          loaded AI/ML models and prediction methods for risk assessment,
                          fraud detection, and personalized recommendations.
                          
    Example:
        >>> service = get_prediction_service()
        >>> print(f"Models loaded: {sum(1 for status in service.model_status.values() if status['loaded'])}")
        >>> Models loaded: 3
