    /**
     * Creates a new financial transaction with comprehensive validation, risk assessment,
     * and compliance verification.
     * 
     * This method implements the complete transaction creation workflow as defined in
     * the Transaction Processing Workflow (section 4.1.1.3). It orchestrates multiple
     * asynchronous service calls to ensure transaction integrity, regulatory compliance,
     * and risk management before proceeding with settlement operations.
     * 
     * Processing Workflow:
     * 1. Validates the incoming transaction request for data integrity and business rules
     * 2. Asynchronously invokes the AI-powered risk assessment engine to calculate risk scores
     * 3. Performs parallel compliance checks including AML screening and sanctions validation
     * 4. Applies conditional logic based on risk score thresholds:
     *    - Low risk (score < 300): Automatic approval and processing
     *    - Medium risk (300-699): Enhanced monitoring with conditional approval
     *    - High risk (â‰¥700): Manual review and approval required
     * 5. Creates initial transaction record with PENDING status in the database
     * 6. Initiates blockchain settlement process for approved transactions
     * 7. Updates transaction status to COMPLETED upon successful blockchain confirmation
     * 8. Triggers notification events for customer and system notifications
     * 9. Returns comprehensive transaction response with current status and details
     * 
     * Risk Assessment Integration:
     * The method integrates with the AI/ML Processing Engine to perform real-time
     * risk scoring using machine learning models that analyze:
     * - Historical transaction patterns and customer behavior
     * - Geographic and temporal risk factors
     * - Transaction amount and frequency analysis
     * - Network effect analysis for connected account relationships
     * - External threat intelligence and fraud indicators
     * 
     * Compliance Validation:
     * Parallel compliance checks are performed including:
     * - Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring
     * - Sanctions screening against global watchlists
     * - Know Your Customer (KYC) verification status validation
     * - Regulatory reporting requirements assessment
     * - Cross-border transaction compliance validation
     * 
     * Blockchain Settlement:
     * For approved transactions, the method coordinates with the Blockchain Settlement
     * Network to:
     * - Execute smart contracts for atomic settlement operations
     * - Create immutable transaction records on the distributed ledger
     * - Ensure cryptographic proof of transaction execution
     * - Handle multi-party consensus validation for complex transactions
     * - Implement rollback mechanisms for failed settlement operations
     * 
     * Error Handling and Recovery:
     * - ValidationException: Thrown for invalid request data or business rule violations
     * - RiskAssessmentException: Thrown when risk assessment services are unavailable
     * - ComplianceException: Thrown for compliance validation failures or violations
     * - SettlementException: Thrown for blockchain settlement failures or timeouts
     * - ServiceUnavailableException: Thrown when critical dependencies are unavailable
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * - Asynchronous processing minimizes response time impact
     * - Caching of risk assessment results for similar transaction patterns
     * - Connection pooling for database and external service interactions
     * - Circuit breaker patterns for external service resilience
     * - Bulk processing optimization for high-volume scenarios
     * 
     * Monitoring and Observability:
     * - Comprehensive metrics collection for transaction success rates and latency
     * - Distributed tracing for end-to-end transaction flow visibility
     * - Real-time alerting for SLA breaches and error rate thresholds
     * - Business metrics tracking for fraud detection and operational insights
