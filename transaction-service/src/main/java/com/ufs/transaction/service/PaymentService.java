/**
 * Service interface for handling payment processing operations within the Unified Financial Services Platform.
 * 
 * This interface defines the contract for the Payment Service, which serves as the core business logic layer
 * for processing financial transactions. It implements the service layer contract for initiating and processing
 * payments that can be settled on the blockchain network, supporting the F-009: Blockchain-based Settlement Network
 * feature and the Transaction Processing Workflow defined in section 4.1.1.
 * 
 * The PaymentService is responsible for orchestrating the complete payment lifecycle including:
 * - Payment request validation and business rule enforcement
 * - AI-powered risk assessment and fraud detection integration  
 * - Regulatory compliance validation and AML screening
 * - Blockchain settlement network integration for immutable transaction recording
 * - Event-driven architecture support through Kafka message publishing
 * - Comprehensive error handling and exception management
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Supports atomic settlement operations through smart contract execution
 * - Implements real-time risk scoring with configurable thresholds
 * - Provides seamless integration with external payment networks
 * - Maintains comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance
 * - Enables horizontal scaling through stateless operation design
 * - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing patterns
 * 
 * Security and Compliance:
 * - All payment operations undergo mandatory KYC/AML validation
 * - PEP screening and sanctions checking are performed automatically
 * - Transaction data is encrypted end-to-end during processing
 * - Audit logging captures all payment processing activities
 * - Role-based access control governs service usage
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Target response time: <500ms for standard payment processing
 * - Throughput capacity: 10,000+ transactions per second
 * - Availability SLA: 99.99% uptime for critical payment operations
 * - Error rate threshold: <0.01% for transaction processing failures
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Unified Data Platform for customer and account information
 * - AI/ML Processing Engine for real-time risk assessment
 * - Event Streaming Platform for asynchronous message publishing
 * - Blockchain Settlement Network for immutable transaction recording
 * - External payment networks and core banking systems

public interface PaymentService {

    /**
     * Processes a payment request through the complete transaction lifecycle including validation,
     * risk assessment, fraud detection, and blockchain settlement.
     * 
     * This method implements the core business logic for the Transaction Processing Workflow
     * as defined in section 4.1.1.3, providing comprehensive payment processing capabilities
     * that integrate with the blockchain-based settlement network for secure, transparent,
     * and immutable transaction recording.
     * 
     * Processing Workflow:
     * 1. Payment Request Validation:
     *    - Validates all required fields and data formats
     *    - Enforces business rules and constraints
     *    - Verifies account ownership and authorization
     *    - Checks account balances and transaction limits
     * 
     * 2. Risk Assessment and Fraud Detection:
     *    - Executes AI-powered risk scoring algorithms
     *    - Performs real-time fraud pattern analysis
     *    - Conducts behavioral analytics and anomaly detection
     *    - Applies configurable risk thresholds and policies
     * 
     * 3. Regulatory Compliance Validation:
     *    - Performs KYC/AML screening and validation
     *    - Executes PEP (Politically Exposed Person) screening
     *    - Conducts sanctions list checking and adverse media scanning
     *    - Validates regulatory transaction reporting requirements
     * 
     * 4. Payment Processing Decision:
     *    - Routes low-risk transactions for automated processing
     *    - Escalates medium-risk transactions for enhanced monitoring
     *    - Requires manual review for high-risk transactions
     *    - Applies circuit breaker patterns for system protection
     * 
     * 5. Blockchain Settlement Execution:
     *    - Initiates smart contract execution for approved transactions
     *    - Performs atomic settlement operations with multi-party validation
     *    - Creates immutable transaction records on the distributed ledger
     *    - Executes consensus mechanisms for transaction finality
     * 
     * 6. Event Publishing and Notification:
     *    - Publishes PaymentEvent messages to Kafka topics for asynchronous processing
     *    - Triggers downstream systems for account updates and notifications
     *    - Generates audit trail entries for regulatory compliance
     *    - Sends customer notifications and transaction confirmations
     * 
     * Error Handling:
     * - Validation failures result in immediate TransactionException with detailed error information
     * - Risk assessment failures trigger automatic escalation workflows
     * - Settlement failures activate rollback mechanisms and compensating transactions
     * - System failures implement circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * - Asynchronous processing for non-critical validation steps
     * - Caching strategies for frequently accessed reference data
     * - Connection pooling for external service integrations
     * - Horizontal scaling support through stateless operation design
     * 
     * Security Measures:
     * - End-to-end encryption for all sensitive payment data
     * - Secure credential management for external service access
     * - Request/response logging with data masking for audit compliance
     * - Rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms
     * 
     * @param paymentRequest The payment request object containing all necessary information
     *                      for processing the transaction. Must include valid amount, currency,
     *                      source account, destination account, and optional description.
     *                      The request is validated against business rules and regulatory
     *                      requirements before processing begins.

     *         - Invalid or incomplete payment request data
     *         - Business rule violations or policy constraints
     *         - Risk assessment failures or fraud detection alerts
     *         - Regulatory compliance violations or screening failures
     *         - Account-related issues (insufficient funds, frozen accounts, etc.)
     *         - External service failures or network connectivity issues
     *         - Blockchain settlement failures or smart contract execution errors
     *         - System errors or unexpected processing failures
     * 
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException when the paymentRequest parameter is null
     *         or contains invalid data that prevents processing from beginning
