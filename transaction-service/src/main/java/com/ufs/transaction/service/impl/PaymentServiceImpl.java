/**
 * Implementation of the PaymentService interface, handling the comprehensive business logic 
 * for payment processing within the Unified Financial Services Platform.
 * 
 * This service implementation serves as the core orchestrator for payment transactions,
 * integrating multiple system components including risk assessment, fraud detection,
 * compliance validation, blockchain settlement, and event-driven communication.
