     * - Account balance reconciliation and audit trails
     * - Transaction history display in customer-facing applications
     * - Risk assessment and fraud detection based on account activity patterns
     * - Regulatory compliance reporting for specific account activities
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Leverages database index on account_id column for optimal query performance
     * - Supports efficient pagination with configurable page sizes
     * - Expected response time: <100ms for typical pagination requests
     * - Handles high-volume accounts with millions of transactions efficiently
     * 
     * Query Optimization:
     * - Utilizes Spring Data JPA derived query method for automatic query generation
     * - PostgreSQL query planner optimizes execution based on account_id index
     * - Pagination parameters prevent memory exhaustion on large result sets
     * - Sorting capabilities through Pageable parameter for custom ordering

     * ```java
     * // Retrieve first 20 transactions for an account, sorted by date descending
     * UUID accountId = UUID.fromString("123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000");
     * Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(0, 20, Sort.by("transactionDate").descending());
     * Page<Transaction> transactions = repository.findByAccountId(accountId, pageable);
     * 
     * // Process results
     * List<Transaction> transactionList = transactions.getContent();
     * long totalTransactions = transactions.getTotalElements();
     * int totalPages = transactions.getTotalPages();
     * ```
     * 
     * @param accountId The UUID of the account for which to retrieve transactions.
     *                  Must not be null. This should be a valid account identifier

    /**
     * Retrieves all transactions associated with a specific customer ID using a custom JPQL query
     * that joins with the Payment entity to establish the customer relationship.
     * 
     * This method implements a sophisticated customer-centric view of transactions by leveraging
     * the relationship between Transaction and Payment entities. The custom JPQL query enables
     * retrieval of all transactions related to a customer across multiple accounts or payment
     * methods, providing a comprehensive view of customer financial activity.
     * 
     * Custom Query Logic:
     * The method uses a JOIN operation between Transaction and Payment entities based on the
     * transaction ID foreign key relationship. This allows identification of transactions
     * associated with a specific customer through the Payment entity's customerId field,
     * enabling customer-centric transaction reporting even in complex multi-account scenarios.
     * 
     * JPQL Query Analysis:
     * - "SELECT t FROM Transaction t": Selects complete Transaction entities
     * - "JOIN Payment p ON t.id = p.transaction.id": Joins with Payment entities via transaction ID
     * - "WHERE p.customerId = :customerId": Filters by the customer ID parameter
     * - Supports all Transaction entity relationships and properties in results
     * 
     * Use Cases:
     * - Customer 360-degree view dashboards showing all customer transactions
     * - Customer service representatives accessing complete transaction history
     * - Risk assessment and fraud detection across customer's entire transaction portfolio
     * - Customer behavior analysis and personalized financial recommendations
     * - Regulatory compliance reporting for specific customer activities
     * - Customer dispute resolution requiring comprehensive transaction analysis
     * - Marketing analytics for customer segmentation and product recommendations
     * 
     * Data Relationship Context:
     * This query assumes a data model where:
     * - Transaction entities represent individual financial transactions
     * - Payment entities link transactions to customers and contain payment-specific details
     * - Multiple transactions can be associated with a single customer through different payments
     * - The relationship enables tracking of customer activity across various transaction types
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * - Query performance depends on proper indexing of Payment.customerId and foreign keys
     * - Pagination prevents memory issues when customers have extensive transaction histories
     * - JOIN operation is optimized for PostgreSQL query planner efficiency
     * - Expected response time: <200ms for paginated customer transaction queries
     * - Recommended indexes: Payment(customer_id), Payment(transaction_id) for optimal performance
     * 
     * Security and Privacy:
     * - Ensures customer data access follows proper authorization patterns
     * - Supports row-level security policies when implemented at database level
     * - Maintains audit trail for customer data access compliance
     * - Compatible with GDPR and other privacy regulation requirements
     * 
     * Example Usage:
     * ```java
     * // Retrieve customer's transaction history for account analysis
