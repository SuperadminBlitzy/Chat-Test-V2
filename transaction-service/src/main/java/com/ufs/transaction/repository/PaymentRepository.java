/**
 * Spring Data JPA Repository interface for Payment entity management within the
 * Unified Financial Services Platform transaction processing system.
 * 
 * This repository provides comprehensive data access operations for payment entities,
 * supporting the complete transaction processing workflow from initiation through
 * settlement and compliance monitoring. The interface leverages Spring Data JPA's
 * powerful querying capabilities to deliver high-performance, scalable payment
 * data operations.
 * 
 * Key Features and Capabilities:
 * 
 * 1. Transaction Processing Support:
 *    - Full lifecycle payment tracking from initiation to completion
 *    - Real-time status monitoring and workflow progression
 *    - Integration with blockchain settlement networks
 *    - Support for multi-currency payment processing
 * 
 * 2. Risk Assessment and Compliance:
 *    - Payment filtering by risk thresholds and compliance criteria
 *    - Suspicious transaction pattern detection
 *    - Regulatory reporting and audit trail queries
 *    - KYC/AML compliance data retrieval
 * 
 * 3. Performance Optimization:
 *    - Index-aware query methods for high-throughput scenarios
 *    - Bulk operations for batch processing workflows
 *    - Optimized pagination for large dataset handling
 *    - Native SQL queries for complex reporting requirements
 * 
 * 4. Financial Operations:
 *    - Amount-based filtering with precise decimal arithmetic
 *    - Currency-specific payment retrieval
 *    - Settlement reconciliation and matching
 *    - Payment gateway integration support
 * 
 * System Requirements Addressed:
 * - Transaction Processing (Technical Specifications/4.1.1/Transaction Processing Workflow):
 *   Supports the complete payment lifecycle within transaction processing workflows
 * - Real-time Transaction Monitoring (F-008): Enables real-time payment status tracking
 *   and performance monitoring for operational dashboards
 * - Blockchain Settlement Network (F-009): Provides data access patterns for blockchain-based
 *   settlement processing and smart contract integration
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Target Response Time: <100ms for single entity operations, <500ms for complex queries
 * - Throughput Capacity: 10,000+ payment queries per second under normal load
 * - Scalability: Horizontal scaling through read replicas and connection pooling
 * - Availability: 99.99% uptime through database clustering and failover mechanisms
 * 
 * Database Optimization:
 * - Recommended indexes: status, created_at, payment_gateway_id, transaction_id
 * - Partition strategy: Consider partitioning by created_at for historical data
 * - Connection pooling: Configured for high-concurrency financial workloads
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - All payment data access is subject to audit logging
 * - Sensitive financial information is encrypted at rest and in transit
 * - Role-based access control enforced at the service layer
 * - Compliance with PCI DSS and financial data protection regulations
