## 5.1 High-Level Architecture

### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Unified Financial Services Platform addresses the critical fragmentation challenges facing Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) institutions. With FSIs using an average of 1,026 applications across their digital landscape and 88% of IT decision makers agreeing that data silos create challenges, this platform serves as a comprehensive solution to unify disparate systems.

The platform employs a **microservices architecture** structured as a collection of loosely coupled services, each designed to execute a specific business function independently. This approach addresses the critical challenges by breaking down monolithic applications into smaller, manageable modules that communicate over well-defined APIs.

**Core Architectural Principles:**

- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Enabling scalability, modularity, and real-time responsiveness crucial for real-time transaction processing
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Utilizing modern cloud-native applications designed to take advantage of cloud infrastructure
- **Hybrid Blockchain Integration**: Incorporating hybrid blockchains that combine the best of public and private blockchain frameworks
- **Zero-Trust Security Model**: Implementing comprehensive security that verifies every access attempt regardless of location

**Decision**: Microservices Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Rationale:**
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale based on demand (e.g., AI inference vs. data storage)
- **Technology Diversity**: Use optimal technology stack for each service (Java for enterprise integration, Python for AI/ML, Go for blockchain)
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade across the entire platform
- **Team Autonomy**: Small teams can own and deploy services independently
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Service boundaries align with compliance domains

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- **Increased Complexity**: Network latency, distributed system challenges, data consistency
- **Operational Overhead**: More deployment units, monitoring complexity, service discovery
- **Development Complexity**: Inter-service communication, transaction management across services

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Service mesh (Istio) for observability and traffic management
- Event sourcing for data consistency and audit trails
- Comprehensive monitoring and distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes) for deployment management

### 5.3.2 Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication

**Hybrid Communication Strategy:**

**Synchronous Communication (REST/GraphQL):**
- **Use Cases**: Account balance queries, payment authorization, real-time user interactions
- **Benefits**: Immediate consistency, simple error handling, request-response clarity

### 5.4.3 Error Handling and Resilience

#### Resilient System Design Patterns

The platform implements comprehensive error handling patterns to ensure system resilience and graceful degradation during failures.

**Error Handling Strategies:**

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```yaml
Circuit Breaker Configuration:
  Failure Threshold: 50% error rate over 10 requests
  Timeout: 30 seconds in open state
  Half-Open Test: Single request after timeout
  Success Threshold: 3 consecutive successes to close
  Fallback: Cached responses or degraded functionality
```

**Retry Mechanisms:**
```yaml
Retry Policies:
  Exponential Backoff:
    Initial Delay: 100ms
    Maximum Delay: 30 seconds
    Multiplier: 2.0
    Maximum Attempts: 5
  
  Jitter: Random delay to prevent thundering herd
  Idempotency: Ensure safe retry operations
  Dead Letter Queue: Failed messages for manual review
```

**Graceful Degradation:**
- **Core Banking Unavailable**: Serve cached customer data, defer non-critical updates
- **Payment Network Issues**: Queue transactions, notify customers of delays
- **AI/ML Service Down**: Use rule-based fallback for risk assessment
- **Database Performance**: Implement read replicas, caching layers

### 5.4.4 Security Framework

Authorization Model:
  RBAC: Role-based access control for basic permissions
  ABAC: Attribute-based access control for fine-grained policies
  Policy Engine: Open Policy Agent (OPA) for centralized policies
  Dynamic Policies: Context-aware authorization decisions
```

**Data Protection:**
```yaml
Encryption Standards:
  At Rest: AES-256-GCM for database encryption
  In Transit: TLS 1.3 for all communications
  Field Level: Sensitive PII encrypted at application level
  Key Management: HashiCorp Vault for key lifecycle
