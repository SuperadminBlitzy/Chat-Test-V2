# Cloud Deployment Strategy for Unified Financial Services Platform

## 1. Overview

The Unified Financial Services Platform leverages a hybrid and multi-cloud deployment strategy to deliver a scalable, resilient, and secure financial services ecosystem. This comprehensive cloud deployment approach ensures high availability, regulatory compliance, and cost optimization across multiple geographic regions while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to evolving business requirements.

### 1.1 Strategic Objectives

- **Scalability**: Support enterprise-scale deployment with dynamic resource allocation
- **Resilience**: Multi-region deployment with automated failover capabilities
- **Security**: Implement secure-by-design principles with comprehensive compliance coverage
- **Cost Optimization**: Leverage cloud-native features for efficient resource utilization
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet diverse regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions

### 1.2 Architecture Principles

The platform follows cloud-native architecture principles with microservices-based design, containerization, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. Banking, software/information services, and telecommunications will together spend $326 billion on public cloud services by 2027, with the AI market in cloud computing projected to reach $97.9 billion by 2025.

## 2. Target Environment Assessment

### 2.1 Hybrid Cloud Model

The platform implements a hybrid cloud architecture combining public and private cloud resources to optimize performance, security, and compliance requirements.
