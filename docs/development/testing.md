## 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

Our testing approach is based on a balanced strategy that combines manual and automated testing across different levels of the application, following the testing pyramid principle with emphasis on unit tests, comprehensive integration testing, and focused end-to-end scenarios.

### 6.6.1.1 Unit Testing

Unit tests form the foundation of our testing pyramid, ensuring that individual components and functions work as expected. Every microservice, function, and component must have corresponding unit tests that validate behavior in isolation.

**Frameworks and Tools**:

| **Python/AI-ML**       | pytest + unittest.mock        | pytest 7.4+, unittest.mock  | ML model testing, data pipeline validation | pytest-cov, Coverage.py        |
| **React/Frontend**     | Jest + React Testing Library  | Jest 29.7+, RTL 14.1+       | Component testing, user interaction testing | Jest coverage reports            |
| **Kotlin/Android**     | JUnit 4 + Mockk              | JUnit 4.13+, Mockk 1.13+    | Android native testing              | JaCoCo Android                    |
| **Swift/iOS**          | XCTest + XCTestMockito        | XCTest (iOS 15+), XCTestMockito 1.0+ | iOS native testing                  | Xcode Code Coverage               |

**Unit Testing Standards**:

- **Test Naming Convention**: `should_[expected_behavior]_when_[scenario]`
- **Test Structure**: Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external dependencies, keep business logic unmocked
- **Test Data**: Use test data builders and factories for consistent test data
- **Parallel Execution**: All unit tests must be capable of parallel execution
- **Test Isolation**: Each test must be independent and not rely on execution order

### 6.6.1.2 Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the interactions between different microservices, components, and external systems, ensuring that the system works correctly when components are combined.
