/**
 * Main application class for the Risk Assessment Service.
 * 
 * This class serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application responsible for
 * implementing the AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine (F-002) as part of the Unified 
 * Financial Services Platform. The service provides critical capabilities including:
 * 
 * - Real-time risk scoring with sub-500ms response times
 * - Predictive risk modeling using machine learning algorithms
 * - Fraud detection and anomaly identification
 * - Risk mitigation recommendations with explainable AI
 * - Integration with unified data platform for comprehensive risk analysis
 * 
 * Architecture Context:
 * This microservice is part of a larger ecosystem that includes:
 * - Unified Data Integration Platform (F-001) - prerequisite for risk assessment
 * - Regulatory Compliance Automation (F-003) - receives risk data for compliance reporting
 * - Digital Customer Onboarding (F-004) - consumes risk scores for onboarding decisions
 * - API Gateway for routing and security
 * - Service discovery for microservices communication
 * 
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - Generate risk scores within 500ms for 99% of requests
 * - Support 5,000+ requests per second throughput
 * - Maintain 99.9% availability (24/7 operation)
 * - Achieve 95% accuracy rate in risk assessment
 * 
 * Compliance and Security:
 * - Implements explainable AI for regulatory compliance
 * - Supports Model Risk Management requirements
 * - Provides audit trails for all risk assessments
 * - Includes bias detection and mitigation capabilities
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Registers with service discovery (Eureka) for discoverability
 * - Connects to unified data platform for customer and transaction data
 * - Integrates with ML model registry for model versioning and updates
 * - Provides REST APIs for other microservices consumption
 * 
 * Technology Stack:
 * - Java 21 LTS for enterprise stability and performance
 * - Spring Boot 3.2+ for rapid microservice development
 * - Spring Cloud 2023.0+ for distributed system capabilities
 * - TensorFlow/PyTorch for machine learning model execution
 * - PostgreSQL for transactional data storage
 * - Redis for high-performance caching

     * Main entry point for the Risk Assessment Service application.
     * 
     * This method bootstraps the Spring Boot application context and starts
     * the embedded web server. The application will:
     * 
     * 1. Initialize Spring Boot auto-configuration
     * 2. Start embedded Tomcat server on configured port
     * 3. Register with service discovery (Eureka) for microservices communication
     * 4. Initialize database connections and connection pools
     * 5. Load ML models and initialize risk assessment engines
     * 6. Configure security, monitoring, and health check endpoints
     * 7. Begin accepting REST API requests for risk assessment
     * 
     * Service Discovery Integration:
     * The @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation ensures this service registers
     * with the discovery server, allowing the API Gateway and other services
     * to locate and communicate with this risk assessment service.
     * 
     * Health and Monitoring:
     * Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are automatically configured for:
     * - Health checks (/actuator/health)
     * - Metrics collection (/actuator/metrics)
     * - Application info (/actuator/info)
     * - Prometheus metrics for monitoring integration
     * 
     * Error Handling:
     * Application startup failures are handled gracefully with:
     * - Detailed logging of initialization errors
     * - Proper exit codes for container orchestration
     * - Retry mechanisms for external service connections
     * 
     * @param args Command line arguments passed to the application.
     *             Common arguments include:
     *             --server.port=8080 (override default port)
     *             --spring.profiles.active=prod (activate production profile)
     *             --eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone (discovery server URL)
