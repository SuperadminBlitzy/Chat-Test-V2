/**
 * RiskProfile Entity - Core component of the AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine
 * 
 * This JPA entity represents a customer's comprehensive risk profile, aggregating
 * various risk factors and historical scores. It serves as the central data model
 * for the AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine, providing real-time risk scoring
 * and predictive modeling capabilities.
 * 
 * Business Requirements Addressed:
 * - F-002: AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine
 * - F-002-RQ-001: Real-time risk scoring (supports <500ms response time)
 * - F-002-RQ-002: Predictive risk modeling (analyzes spending habits, investment behaviors)
 * - F-002-RQ-003: Model explainability (stores aggregated risk factors for transparency)
 * - Dynamic Risk Management: Optimizes KYC onboarding and threat detection
 * 
 * Technical Architecture:
 * - Unidirectional relationship: RiskFactor â†’ RiskProfile (breaks circular dependency)
 * - Direct collection of RiskFactor entities removed for performance optimization
 * - Risk factors accessed via repository queries rather than direct collection
 * - Historical risk scores maintained for trend analysis and audit compliance
 * 
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - Supports 5,000+ risk assessment requests per second
 * - Sub-500ms response time for risk profile retrieval
 * - 95% accuracy rate in risk assessment calculations
 * - 99.9% system availability for critical financial services
 * 
 * Data Management:
 * - PostgreSQL for transactional data consistency
 * - Automated timestamps for audit trail compliance
 * - Unique customer identifier constraints for data integrity
 * - Cascade operations for related risk score management
 * 
 * Security & Compliance:
 * - Supports SOC2, PCI DSS, GDPR compliance requirements
 * - Audit logging capabilities through timestamp tracking
 * - Role-based access control integration ready
 * - End-to-end encryption support for sensitive risk data
