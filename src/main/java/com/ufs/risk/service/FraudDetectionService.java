    /**
     * Analyzes a transaction to detect potential fraud using AI-powered machine learning models.
     * 
     * This method serves as the primary entry point for fraud detection analysis within the
     * UFS risk assessment ecosystem. It leverages advanced machine learning algorithms trained
     * on historical transaction patterns, customer behaviors, and real-time risk factors to
     * generate comprehensive fraud risk assessments.
     * 
     * Algorithm Overview:
     * The fraud detection process employs a multi-layered approach combining:
     * 1. Feature Engineering: Extracts 100+ features from transaction and customer data
     * 2. Ensemble Models: Utilizes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks
     * 3. Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns in transaction behavior
     * 4. Behavioral Analysis: Compares against established customer behavior baselines
     * 5. Risk Scoring: Generates numerical scores with confidence intervals
     * 6. Explainability: Provides transparent reasoning for regulatory compliance
     * 
     * Data Sources Integration:
     * - Real-time transaction data from unified data integration platform
     * - Customer profiles with unified view across all touchpoints
     * - Historical transaction patterns and behavior analytics
     * - External threat intelligence and fraud pattern databases
     * - Device fingerprinting and geolocation risk assessments
     * - Merchant risk scoring and category-based analysis
     * 
     * Risk Assessment Factors:
     * - Transaction amount relative to customer profile and history
     * - Geographic and temporal pattern analysis
     * - Device and IP address reputation scoring
     * - Merchant category and risk assessment
     * - Customer behavior deviation analysis
     * - Velocity and frequency pattern detection
     * - Cross-channel transaction correlation
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Target response time: <500ms for 99% of requests
     * - Concurrent processing: 5,000+ requests per second
     * - Model accuracy: 95% with continuous improvement through ML pipelines
     * - False positive rate: <2% to minimize customer friction
     * - Real-time processing with in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
     * 
     * Fraud Score Interpretation:
     * - 0-200: Low Risk - Proceed with normal transaction processing
     * - 201-500: Medium Risk - Apply enhanced verification and monitoring
     * - 501-750: High Risk - Require manual review and additional authentication
     * - 751-1000: Critical Risk - Block transaction and trigger investigation
