/**
 * Represents an event that is created when a potential fraud is detected by the
 * AI-Powered Risk Assessment Engine (F-002) and Fraud Detection System (F-006).
 * 
 * This event serves as the primary communication mechanism in the event-driven
 * architecture for fraud detection workflows, enabling real-time transaction 
 * monitoring (F-008) and asynchronous processing of fraud alerts across the
 * distributed microservices ecosystem.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Business Context:</strong></p>
 * This event is a critical component of the Unified Financial Services Platform's
 * fraud detection capabilities, addressing the industry challenge where financial
 * institutions lose approximately $6.08 million per data breach (25% higher than
 * global average). The event enables immediate response to potential fraudulent
 * activities while maintaining the sub-500ms response time requirements for the
 * AI-powered risk assessment engine.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Architecture Integration:</strong></p>
 * - Published to Apache Kafka topics for high-throughput event streaming (10,000+ TPS)
 * - Consumed by downstream services including alerting, logging, and mitigation systems
 * - Supports both real-time processing and batch analytics for fraud pattern analysis
 * - Integrates with the blockchain-based settlement network for immutable audit trails
 * - Enables compliance automation through comprehensive event tracking and reporting
 * 
 * <p><strong>Event-Driven Processing Flow:</strong></p>
 * 1. AI/ML Risk Assessment Engine detects potential fraud during transaction analysis
 * 2. FraudDetectionEvent is created with comprehensive fraud detection metadata
 * 3. Event is published to Kafka topic 'fraud-detection-events' with appropriate partitioning
 * 4. Multiple consumer services process the event for different purposes:
 *    - Alert Service: Immediate notifications to customers and risk teams
 *    - Audit Service: Immutable logging for regulatory compliance and investigation
 *    - Analytics Service: Real-time fraud pattern analysis and model improvement
 *    - Mitigation Service: Automated fraud prevention measures (account freezing, etc.)
 *    - Reporting Service: Regulatory reporting and compliance dashboard updates
 * 
 * <p><strong>Performance Characteristics:</strong></p>
 * - Event serialization/deserialization optimized for sub-millisecond processing
 * - Supports high-volume fraud detection scenarios (5,000+ events per second)
 * - Minimal memory footprint through efficient data structure design
 * - Compatible with Kafka's exactly-once delivery semantics for data consistency
 * 
 * <p><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong></p>
 * - All event data encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption
 * - Supports SOC2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR compliance requirements
 * - Comprehensive audit trail generation for regulatory investigations
 * - Sensitive data handling through the included FraudDetectionRequest object
 * - Zero-trust security model with continuous verification of event authenticity
 * 
 * <p><strong>Data Retention and Lifecycle:</strong></p>
 * - Events retained in Kafka for 90 days for real-time processing and replay
 * - Long-term archival to AWS S3/Azure Blob Storage for regulatory compliance
 * - Automated data purging based on configurable retention policies
 * - Support for event replay during disaster recovery scenarios
 * 
 * <p><strong>Integration with External Systems:</strong></p>
 * - SWIFT network integration for cross-border fraud detection
 * - Core banking system integration for immediate account actions
 * - Credit bureau integration for enhanced fraud scoring
 * - Payment network integration for real-time transaction blocking
 * - Regulatory database integration for sanctions and watchlist checking
 * 
 * <p><strong>Monitoring and Observability:</strong></p>
 * - Comprehensive metrics collection for event processing rates and latencies
 * - Distributed tracing support for end-to-end fraud detection workflow visibility
 * - Custom business metrics for fraud detection accuracy and false positive rates
 * - Real-time alerting for event processing failures or performance degradation
 * - Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for operational insights
 * 
 * <p><strong>Error Handling and Resilience:</strong></p>
 * - Circuit breaker patterns for downstream service failures
 * - Dead letter queue support for failed event processing
 * - Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
 * - Graceful degradation when external dependencies are unavailable
 * - Comprehensive error logging and notification for operational teams
 * 
 * <p><strong>Future Extensibility:</strong></p>
 * The event structure is designed for extensibility to support future fraud detection
 * enhancements including machine learning model improvements, blockchain-based
 * fraud verification, and integration with emerging payment technologies while
 * maintaining backward compatibility for existing consumers.
