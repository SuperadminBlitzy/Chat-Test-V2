/**
 * Notification Service Main Router
 * 
 * This file serves as the central routing hub for the notification service, combining
 * all notification-related routes into a unified Express router. It implements the
 * primary routing layer for Feature F-008 (Real-time Transaction Monitoring) and
 * Feature F-013 (Customer Dashboard) as specified in the technical requirements.
 * 
 * The router provides a comprehensive routing solution for the financial services
 * platform's notification capabilities, supporting high-volume transaction monitoring,
 * customer communications, and regulatory compliance notifications within a
 * microservices architecture capable of handling 10,000+ TPS.
 * 
 * Technical Architecture:
 * - Modular router composition using Express.js 4.18.2
 * - RESTful API design with resource-based routing patterns
 * - Comprehensive middleware chain for security and validation
 * - Event-driven architecture integration for real-time processing
 * - Enterprise-grade error handling and audit logging
 * 
 * Business Context:
 * - Supports real-time transaction alerts and fraud detection notifications
 * - Enables customer dashboard communication workflows
 * - Facilitates regulatory compliance through standardized notification templates
 * - Provides foundation for AI-powered risk assessment communications
 * - Implements audit trails for financial services compliance (SOC2, PCI DSS, GDPR)
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Target response time: <1 second for notification operations
 * - Throughput capacity: 5,000+ notification requests per second
 * - 99.9% availability SLA with automatic failover capabilities
 * - Sub-500ms processing time for critical transaction alerts
 * - Horizontal scaling support through stateless design
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - OAuth2 authentication with JWT token validation
 * - Comprehensive request validation using Zod schemas
 * - Rate limiting and DDoS protection through middleware
 * - End-to-end encryption for sensitive financial data
 * - Zero-trust architecture with continuous verification
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - API Gateway routing for external client access
 * - Service mesh integration for internal microservice communication
 * - Event bus connectivity for asynchronous notification processing
 * - Monitoring and alerting system integration for operational insights
 * - Database connectivity for persistent notification tracking
 * 
 * Compliance Features:
 * - Complete audit trail for all notification operations
 * - Data retention policies aligned with financial regulations
 * - GDPR compliance with customer consent and data privacy controls
 * - SOC2 Type II compliance through comprehensive security controls
 * - PCI DSS compliance for payment-related communications

/**
 * Express Router Configuration
 * 
 * Creates the main Express router instance that will serve as the central
 * routing hub for all notification service endpoints. The router is configured
 * with specific options to ensure consistent behavior across the financial
 * services platform.
 * 
 * Router Configuration Options:
 * - caseSensitive: Enables case-sensitive routing for precise URL matching
 * - strict: Enables strict routing to prevent trailing slash ambiguity
 * - mergeParams: Merges URL parameters from parent routers for nested routing
 * 
 * Design Rationale:
 * - Case sensitivity ensures consistent API endpoint behavior
 * - Strict routing prevents confusion with URL variations
 * - Parameter merging supports hierarchical routing structures
 * - Consistent configuration across all service routers
 * 
 * @constant {Router} router - Main Express router instance for notification service

/**
 * Global Middleware: Request Correlation and Audit Logging
 * 
 * This middleware provides comprehensive request tracking and audit logging
 * capabilities essential for financial services compliance and operational
 * monitoring. It ensures every request has a unique correlation ID for
 * distributed tracing and maintains detailed audit trails.
 * 
 * Middleware Features:
 * - Correlation ID generation for distributed request tracing
 * - Comprehensive request logging for security and compliance auditing
 * - Performance timing for SLA monitoring and optimization
 * - IP address tracking for security analysis and fraud detection
 * - User agent logging for client identification and analytics
 * 
 * Compliance Benefits:
 * - Complete audit trail for regulatory reporting
 * - Request/response correlation for incident investigation
 * - Performance metrics for SLA compliance monitoring
 * - Security event logging for threat detection and analysis
 * 
 * Performance Impact:
 * - Minimal overhead through efficient logging mechanisms
 * - Asynchronous logging to prevent request blocking
 * - Structured logging format for efficient parsing and analysis
 * - Optimized for high-throughput financial service requirements
